{"question": "What is the primary role of the Dungeon Master (DM) in Dungeons & Dragons?", "answer": "The Dungeon Master presides over the game, narrates the story, plays non-player characters and monsters, referees the rules, and ensures everyone at the table is having fun."}
{"question": "How should a DM handle a situation where the rules are unclear?", "answer": "When it's not clear what ought to happen next, the DM decides how to interpret and apply the rules, prioritizing the group's fun and fairness."}
{"question": "Q: What is the recommended approach for Dungeon Masters to handle mistakes or oversights during gameplay?", "answer": "It's OK to Make Mistakes. If you overlook or misrepresent something, correct yourself and move on. No one expects you to memorize every rule or detail. Even if you don't realize your mistake until after a game session is over, it's OK to acknowledge the mistake at the start of the next session and make adjustments moving forward."}
{"question": "What is the main purpose of the Dungeon Master's Guide?", "answer": "The Dungeon Master's Guide provides advice, tools, rules, and inspiration for Dungeon Masters to create and run adventures and campaigns."}
{"question": "Are players allowed to consult the Monster Manual while fighting a monster?", "answer": "No, it is generally considered inappropriate for players to look up a monster's statistics or abilities while actively fighting it, as this spoils the challenge and surprise."}
{"question": "What is the typical recommended number of players (excluding the DM) for a D&D game?", "answer": "D&D plays best with four to six players, although it's possible to run games with fewer or more."}
{"question": "What is a 'one-shot' game, and why might it be useful for new groups?", "answer": "A 'one-shot' is a single-session game. It's useful for new groups as a way for people to try D&D without a long-term commitment, potentially making them more willing to commit later if they enjoy it."}
{"question": "Q: What is the recommended approach for scheduling games, especially for new groups?", "answer": "Scheduling a single-session game (often called a \"one-shot\") as a way for people to try it out can be helpful in getting players committed to longer-term play."}
{"question": "How should a DM handle accommodating players' accessibility needs?", "answer": "The DM should accommodate accessibility needs they reasonably can and communicate clearly and early about any needs they cannot accommodate."}
{"question": "Q: What is recommended for each player to have?", "answer": "Their own set of polyhedral dice and a character sheet. While not necessary, most play groups have a miniature to represent their characters."}
{"question": "What constitutes a 'full set' of standard polyhedral dice for D&D?", "answer": "A full set includes at least one of each: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20. Often percentile dice (two d10s) are included."}
{"question": "Who should typically record important details like clues and treasure found during an adventure?", "answer": "At least one player should take notes to record clues, treasure, and other important information the characters collect."}
{"question": "Q: What is the recommended size for a battle grid?", "answer": "A vinyl wet-erase mat with a printed grid, or any other surface marked in 1-inch squares."}
{"question": "What is the standard size represented by one square on a D&D battle grid?", "answer": "Each square on a standard battle grid represents a 5-foot-by-5-foot area."}
{"question": "What are some examples of significant 'things' a group might accomplish in roughly one hour of D&D playtime?", "answer": "Examples include exploring a location (like a room), having a meaningful conversation with an NPC, resolving a group disagreement, solving a puzzle, overcoming a trap, or completing a low-difficulty combat encounter."}
{"question": "If a DM only has one hour to prepare for a session using a published adventure, what should they prioritize?", "answer": "They should focus on understanding the adventure's story and key plot points, identifying the most likely encounters (combat, social, exploration), and reviewing the details (monster stats/tactics, NPC notes, key clues) for those definite encounters."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of starting a D&D session (after the first) with a recap?", "answer": "A recap helps players get back into the story and provides important context for any players who might have missed the previous session."}
{"question": "Q: Can a DM gloss over mundane details during a rest period without losing the players' interest?", "answer": "Yes, it is okay for a DM to gloss over mundane details and return to the action as quickly as possible. A campaign can look different between different playgroups. Some will focus on combat, others will want world-building. As the DM, it is important to consider what your specific playgroup finds important and accommodate this when possible."}
{"question": "Should a DM interrupt player discussion during exploration or planning?", "answer": "Not necessarily. DMs should learn to recognize times when players are engaging in in-character discussion or planning and allow them space, resuming the action when the players are ready."}
{"question": "What is a 'cliffhanger' ending for a session?", "answer": "Ending a session just as something monumental or surprising happens, creating suspense and excitement for the next session, even if it means pausing mid-encounter."}
{"question": "If a player character misses a session, how should the DM handle their absence and return?", "answer": "Options include having the character 'fade into the background' temporarily, creating a narrative reason for their absence and return, or having another player or the DM run the character with the absent player's consent. The character should still receive XP."}
{"question": "Q: What is the recommended approach for planning a Dungeons & Dragons game in terms of preplanning versus improvisation?", "answer": "Do you like to plan thoroughly, or do you prefer to improvise? As a DM, you will need to adapt to both skill sets. Having an idea of where you want the story to go is important, however it's important to improvise when your players go a direction you don't expect. Otherwise, you risk 'railroading' them, or making their actions have no agency. A common strategy is to plan for an encounter or location, and adapt it to the player's decisions. This way you are prepared, and they feel their choices impact the story."}
{"question": "Q: What is the purpose of recording rules interpretations?", "answer": "To add to a collection of house rules for future reference. The beauty of the game is that it is so open ended, you can tweak it to your preferences. The house rules interpretation can be thought of as an additional source book alongside the official ones."}
{"question": "What does it mean if a rule is described as an 'exception'?", "answer": "An exception is a specific rule (from a class feature, spell, magic item, etc.) that contradicts a general rule. When an exception and a general rule disagree, the exception takes precedence."}
{"question": "What are the three main pillars of D&D gameplay?", "answer": "The three main pillars are social interaction (talking to NPCs, negotiation), exploration (navigating environments, finding clues, overcoming obstacles), and combat (fighting monsters and villains)."}
{"question": "When should a DM call for a D20 Skill Check?", "answer": "A DM should call for a D20 Skill Check when a character attempts an action where the outcome is uncertain, there's a chance of both success and failure, and failure has meaningful consequences."}
{"question": "What's the difference between an Ability Check and a Saving Throw?", "answer": "An Ability Check is typically made when a character actively tries to do something. A Saving Throw is usually a reactive attempt to resist or avoid an external threat like a spell, trap, or poison."}
{"question": "What is the typical DC for an 'Easy', 'Medium', and 'Hard' task?", "answer": "Typical DCs (Difficulty Checks) are 10 for Easy, 15 for Medium, and 20 for Hard tasks."}
{"question": "What happens if a character fails an ability check but could theoretically try again?", "answer": "If failure has no consequences other than lost time, the DM might allow retries (possibly taking more time) or rule that the character eventually succeeds after a certain duration without repeated checks."}
{"question": "What is a group check and when is it used?", "answer": "A group check is used when the party attempts something together where success or failure affects the group collectively. Everyone makes the check, and if at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds. It's not suitable if one failure means disaster for all."}
{"question": "How is Passive Perception calculated and what is it used for?", "answer": "Passive Perception is calculated as 10 + all modifiers that normally apply to a Wisdom (Perception) check. The DM uses it to determine if a character notices something hidden or subtle when they aren't actively searching."}
{"question": "Can an attack roll be used outside of combat?", "answer": "Yes, attack rolls can be used to resolve noncombat activities like participating in an archery contest or a game of darts, where the DM assigns an AC to the target."}
{"question": "Q: What happens when a player's preferred activity doesn't match an encounter in the adventure?", "answer": "It's rare for all players to enjoy the same aspects of the game, but finding a balance allows everyone to get some enjoyment out of each game session."}
{"question": "Q: What happens when a Dungeon Master tailors an adventure to a player's preference?", "answer": "The Dungeon Master can create and run adventures that the players will enjoy and remember."}
{"question": "What is the formula for a typical spell save DC?", "answer": "The formula is 8 + the caster's spellcasting ability modifier + the caster's Proficiency Bonus."}
{"question": "What happens if a character has multiple sources of Advantage or Disadvantage on the same roll?", "answer": "Multiple instances of Advantage don't stack; you still only roll two d20s and take the higher. Similarly, multiple instances of Disadvantage don't stack. If you have both Advantage and Disadvantage on the same roll, they cancel each other out, and you roll only one d20."}
{"question": "What does it mean for a weapon to have the 'Finesse' property?", "answer": "When attacking with a Finesse weapon, you can choose to use either your Strength or your Dexterity modifier for both the attack and damage rolls."}
{"question": "What does it mean for a weapon to have the 'Versatile' property?", "answer": "A Versatile weapon can be used with one or two hands. It deals the damage listed in parentheses when used with two hands to make a melee attack."}
{"question": "Can I make two attacks if I wield a light weapon in one hand and nothing in the other?", "answer": "No. The Light property allows an extra attack as a Bonus Action only if you attack with a *different* light weapon in your other hand during your Attack action."}
{"question": "What is Difficult Terrain?", "answer": "Difficult Terrain includes areas like low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, or shallow bogs. Every foot of movement in Difficult Terrain costs 1 extra foot of speed."}
{"question": "Can I move through a space occupied by a hostile creature?", "answer": "Yes, you can move through a hostile creature's space only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Otherwise, their space is considered Difficult Terrain, and you generally cannot willingly end your move in their space."}
{"question": "What is an Opportunity Attack?", "answer": "When a hostile creature you can see leaves your reach, you can use your Reaction to make one melee attack against it. This attack occurs right before the creature leaves your reach."}
{"question": "How can you avoid provoking an Opportunity Attack when moving away from an enemy?", "answer": "You can take the Disengage action, which prevents your movement from provoking Opportunity Attacks for the rest of your turn. You also don't provoke one if you Teleport or are moved unwillingly (like being pushed by a spell)."}
{"question": "How is damage calculated on a Critical Hit?", "answer": "When you score a Critical Hit, you roll all of the attack's damage dice twice, add them together, then add any relevant modifiers as normal. For example, a dagger (1d4) crits, you roll 2d4 plus your ability modifier."}
{"question": "What is the difference between Damage Resistance and Damage Vulnerability?", "answer": "Resistance means you take half damage from a specific damage type (rounded down). Vulnerability means you take double damage from that specific damage type."}
{"question": "What happens when a character drops to 0 Hit Points?", "answer": "They either die instantly (if the damage meets or exceeds their maximum HP after reaching 0) or they fall Unconscious and must start making Death Saving Throws."}
{"question": "How do Death Saving Throws work?", "answer": "At the start of your turn while at 0 HP, roll a d20. A 10 or higher is a success, below 10 is a failure. Three successes mean you become Stable. Three failures mean you die. Rolling a 1 counts as two failures. Rolling a 20 means you regain 1 HP."}
{"question": "What does the 'Stable' condition mean?", "answer": "A Stable creature is at 0 Hit Points and Unconscious, but no longer needs to make Death Saving Throws. Taking damage makes them unstable again. They regain 1 HP after 1d4 hours if not healed sooner."}
{"question": "Can Temporary Hit Points bring an Unconscious character back to consciousness?", "answer": "No. Temporary Hit Points are not actual Hit Points and cannot restore consciousness or stabilize a dying creature. Only regaining actual Hit Points can do that."}
{"question": "What effect does the Blinded condition have?", "answer": "A Blinded creature automatically fails any ability check that requires sight. Attack rolls against the creature have Advantage, and the creature's own attack rolls have Disadvantage."}
{"question": "What are the effects of the Restrained condition?", "answer": "A Restrained creature's speed becomes 0, attack rolls against it have Advantage, its attack rolls have Disadvantage, and it has Disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws."}
{"question": "What does the Spellcasting Focus replace?", "answer": "A Spellcasting Focus can be used in place of Material (M) components for a spell, unless that component has a specific cost listed or is consumed by the spell."}
{"question": "What is required to cast a spell with a Somatic (S) component?", "answer": "The caster must have at least one hand free to perform the necessary gestures."}
{"question": "Can you cast a spell with a spell slot using your action and another spell with a spell slot using your Bonus Action on the same turn?", "answer": "No. If you cast a spell using a Bonus Action, the only other spells you can cast on that same turn are cantrips with a casting time of 1 action."}
{"question": "How does Concentration work for spells?", "answer": "Some spells require Concentration to maintain their effect. If you cast another spell requiring Concentration, lose Concentration due to taking damage (failing a CON save), or become Incapacitated, the first spell ends."}
{"question": "What are the benefits of casting a spell as a Ritual?", "answer": "Casting a spell as a Ritual takes 10 minutes longer than its normal casting time, but it does not expend a spell slot. The spell must have the Ritual tag, and the caster must have it prepared (or in their spellbook for Wizards)."}
{"question": "How do spell effects combine if cast multiple times on the same target?", "answer": "The effects of the *same* spell cast multiple times don't combine. Instead, the most potent effect (highest bonus, highest DC, etc.) from those castings applies while their durations overlap. If equally potent, the most recent casting applies."}
{"question": "How do you calculate the spell slots for a multiclassed character?", "answer": "Add together all levels in Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard; half the levels (round up) in Paladin/Ranger; and one-third levels (round down) in Eldritch Knight/Arcane Trickster. Use the total level on the Multiclass Spellcaster table to find available slots."}
{"question": "If a multiclass character has spell slots of a higher level than any spell they know or can prepare, can they use those slots?", "answer": "Yes, they can use those higher-level slots to cast lower-level spells they know/prepare. Casting a spell this way uses the higher slot level, potentially enhancing the spell's effect if it has rules for being upcast."}
{"question": "Q: What type of mechanics or elements should be included in an adventure to engage players who like to instigate action?", "answer": "Allowing their actions to affect the environment, including things in your adventures to tempt them, letting their actions put the characters in a tight spot, and encounters with NPCs who are as feisty and unpredictable as the players are."}
{"question": "Q: What is the purpose of allowing a player's action to affect the environment?", "answer": "To engage players who like to instigate by giving them agency in shaping the world around them."}
{"question": "Q: What is the purpose of providing quantifiable rewards in noncombat encounters?", "answer": "To engage players who enjoy optimizing their characters' capabilities."}
{"question": "Q: What is the recommended approach for engaging players who enjoy solving problems?", "answer": "Include puzzles and tricky situations that require thinking, reward planning and tactics with in-game benefits, and create NPCs with complex motives."}
{"question": "Q: What is the recommended approach for handling players who primarily come to the game for socializing and are not deeply invested in the adventure?", "answer": "Don't try to force them to be more involved than they want to be. Remember that in any given play group, different players may enjoy different parts of the game. Some players may like to make voices, others might love combat, ands still others may want to steal everything they can. It's important as the DM to accommodate the players' preferences while creating an inclusive environment and an adventure they all feel like they contribute to."}
{"question": "How can a DM effectively use player character backstories in a campaign?", "answer": "A DM can weave elements from character backstories into the campaign's plotlines, creating adventures or encounters that are personally relevant to the characters and shaping the ongoing narrative."}
{"question": "Should a DM-controlled adventurer (DM PC) make decisions for the party?", "answer": "No, a DM PC should not make decisions for the group. The DM should ensure the players retain agency and the spotlight remains on their characters."}
{"question": "What are the challenges and considerations if a player runs two characters simultaneously?", "answer": "While possible, running two characters is challenging, especially for roleplaying. The player should be comfortable with the added complexity. Often, one character takes a primary roleplaying focus while the other is more supportive."}
{"question": "How can providing information like enemy Armor Class speed up combat?", "answer": "Sharing information like AC allows players to quickly determine if their attack hits without needing confirmation from the DM for each roll, streamlining the process."}
{"question": "How should Experience Points (XP) be handled for a character whose player missed a session?", "answer": "The absent character should receive the same XP as the characters who were present, ensuring the party levels up together."}
{"question": "When a new player joins an ongoing campaign, what level should their character be?", "answer": "The new character should typically start at the same level as the existing characters in the party."}
{"question": "In a campaign with multiple DMs sharing the same world, can characters move between regions run by different DMs?", "answer": "Yes, the concept allows for characters to potentially travel between different DMs' regions, creating continuity across different storylines."}
{"question": "If multiple DMs run a session together, how are their own player characters handled?", "answer": "When a player who is also a DM takes their turn running the game, their own player character steps out of the action and doesn't participate until the player resumes their player role."}
{"question": "Why is brevity recommended when the DM describes scenes or locations?", "answer": "Keeping descriptions short and evocative helps maintain player interest and focuses attention on the most important details and clues, rather than overwhelming players with excessive information."}
{"question": "What senses can a DM appeal to when describing a location to create atmosphere?", "answer": "A DM can describe sights, sounds, smells, textures (touch), and occasionally tastes to make a location more immersive and memorable."}
{"question": "Should a DM use narration to restrict what actions players attempt?", "answer": "Generally, no. Narration should provide information and options, but DMs should avoid putting unnecessary limitations on character actions beyond the game's rules."}
{"question": "When presenting players with choices (like paths or doors), what technique makes the choice more meaningful?", "answer": "Adding distinct sensory details or clues to each option helps players make more informed decisions rather than choosing randomly."}
{"question": "What methods can a DM use to privately convey information to a single player?", "answer": "Methods include pulling the player aside briefly (an 'Aside'), passing a written note, sending a direct message in online play, or having other players temporarily leave the room for short scenes."}
{"question": "Under what conditions should a DM typically call for an Ability Check versus a Saving Throw?", "answer": "Call for an Ability Check when a character actively attempts a task with uncertain outcome (like climbing, persuading, sneaking). Call for a Saving Throw when a character must reactively resist or avoid a harmful effect (like a spell, trap, or poison)."}
{"question": "What are the standard Difficulty Class (DC) values for Easy, Medium, and Hard tasks?", "answer": "The standard DCs are DC 10 for Easy, DC 15 for Medium, and DC 20 for Hard tasks."}
{"question": "Can attack rolls be used to resolve outcomes outside of combat?", "answer": "Yes, attack rolls can be used for activities like archery contests or games of darts. The DM assigns an AC to the target, and the player makes an attack roll to determine success."}
{"question": "How is the Difficulty Class (DC) determined for a saving throw forced by a spell or monster ability?", "answer": "The spell or ability description usually specifies the DC. For spells cast by characters, the DC is typically calculated as 8 + caster's spellcasting ability modifier + caster's Proficiency Bonus."}
{"question": "What is the result if a roll is affected by both Advantage and Disadvantage?", "answer": "If a roll has both Advantage and Disadvantage from different sources, they cancel each other out, and the roll is made normally with a single d20."}
{"question": "Can failing an ability check by a large margin have worse consequences than failing by a small margin?", "answer": "Yes, the DM can implement 'degrees of failure,' where failing a check by 5 or more might trigger a worse outcome than failing by only 1 or 2."}
{"question": "According to the 'Improvising Damage' table, what is an example of damage severe enough to be potentially 'Deadly' for characters level 5-10?", "answer": "Examples include being hit by falling rubble in a collapsing tunnel or tumbling into a vat of acid, typically dealing around 22 (4d10) damage."}
{"question": "Can a DM use random generation tables (like those for settlements or NPCs) to aid improvisation during a game?", "answer": "Yes, random tables are useful tools for quickly generating names, details, or events when players go in unexpected directions."}
{"question": "What are the primary ways DMs resolve social interactions?", "answer": "Social interactions are typically resolved through a combination of roleplaying (acting out the character's dialogue and intentions) and ability checks (like Charisma checks for Persuasion, Deception, Intimidation, or Performance), with the balance decided by the DM."}
{"question": "How can a DM engage players who are less comfortable with active roleplaying during social encounters?", "answer": "The DM can prompt these players to describe their character's actions, body language, or general attitude during the conversation, rather than requiring them to speak in character."}
{"question": "Does an NPC's alignment dictate their personality and behavior?", "answer": "Alignment provides a general guideline for an NPC's moral and ethical outlook, which can inform their personality and likely reactions, but it doesn't dictate every action. Specific personality traits, bonds, flaws, and goals are more influential."}
{"question": "What is the main purpose of using a map in D&D?", "answer": "Maps help the DM and players visualize the layout of an adventure location (like a dungeon, settlement, or wilderness area) and track character positions, especially during exploration and combat."}
{"question": "What time scale is typically used when tracking movement and actions within a dungeon or settlement?", "answer": "Movement and exploration within dungeons or settlements are usually tracked in minutes."}
{"question": "Does a character need to make an ability check every time they study something, like a book or inscription?", "answer": "Not necessarily. If a character is simply reading general text, no check may be needed. However, if they are searching for specific clues, deciphering complex text, recalling related lore, or trying to understand something obscure, the DM might call for an Intelligence check (Investigation, History, Arcana, etc.)."}
{"question": "How can a DM determine a monster's Initiative without rolling, and how does Advantage/Disadvantage affect it?", "answer": "Monsters have a listed Initiative score (often 10 + Dex modifier). If the monster has Advantage on the roll, add 5 to this score. If it has Disadvantage, subtract 5."}
{"question": "What are some methods for openly tracking Initiative so all players can see the turn order?", "answer": "Methods include using a whiteboard, a battle mat, folded index cards on the DM screen, virtual tabletop tools, or physical trackers like magnets or clothespins."}
{"question": "How can a DM differentiate identical monsters during combat when using miniatures?", "answer": "Use unique miniatures if possible. If using identical ones, tag them with distinct markers like colored stickers, numbered bases, or temporary marks with a dry-erase marker."}
{"question": "Can players track conditions affecting their characters on their character sheets?", "answer": "Yes, players should track conditions affecting their own characters. While the DMG suggests *avoiding* placing physical sticky notes *directly* on sheets (potentially obscuring info), players can certainly note conditions in designated areas or margins of their sheet."}
{"question": "What is a practical way to track combatant positions when the distances involved are too large for a standard battle grid?", "answer": "One method is to use dice as range counters next to miniatures, representing distance traveled or distance from a reference point, without needing a grid."}
{"question": "How can a DM award Experience Points (XP) for overcoming noncombat challenges?", "answer": "The DM can estimate the difficulty of the noncombat challenge (e.g., tense negotiation, dangerous exploration) using combat encounter guidelines and award a comparable amount of XP."}
{"question": "Under the optional 'Training to Gain Levels' rule, what determines the time and cost required?", "answer": "The time and cost depend on the level being attained, as specified in the Training to Gain Levels table (e.g., 40 days and 80 GP for levels 17-20)."}
{"question": "What is a common rate for session-based level advancement in the early levels (1-4)?", "answer": "A common guideline is reaching level 2 after the first session, level 3 after the second session, and level 4 after two more sessions (totaling four sessions to reach level 4)."}
{"question": "What is the function of Alignment in D&D?", "answer": "Alignment serves as a roleplaying tool, offering a shorthand description of a creature's general moral and ethical outlook (Good/Evil/Neutral and Lawful/Chaotic/Neutral)."}
{"question": "Can a character's alignment change over time?", "answer": "Yes, if a character's actions consistently deviate from their chosen alignment, the player should consider changing the alignment to better reflect the character's behavior."}
{"question": "Does a character's actions *always* have to match their alignment?", "answer": "No, characters can occasionally act outside their alignment. Alignment describes typical behavior and core beliefs, not rigid constraints. Consistent actions, however, *define* the alignment."}
{"question": "What is the likely initial attitude of a Lawful Good NPC towards adventurers?", "answer": "A Lawful Good NPC is likely to have a Friendly initial attitude, predisposed to help."}
{"question": "What is the likely initial attitude of a Chaotic Evil monster?", "answer": "A Chaotic Evil monster is likely to have a Hostile initial attitude, inclined to hinder or attack."}
{"question": "When does a chase sequence begin, and what needs to be determined?", "answer": "A chase begins when at least one creature (quarry) flees from at least one other creature (pursuer). Participants roll Initiative if not already in order, and the DM determines the starting distance between them."}
{"question": "Can creatures make Opportunity Attacks against each other during a standard chase?", "answer": "No, participants in a chase are generally assumed to be moving in the same direction, so they don't provoke Opportunity Attacks *from each other*. They can still provoke them from creatures *not* in the chase."}
{"question": "How does a quarry escape from pursuers during a chase?", "answer": "If the quarry can get out of sight, they make a Dexterity (Stealth) check at the end of the round. If the check total exceeds the highest Passive Perception score among the pursuers, the quarry escapes."}
{"question": "What happens if a quarry attempts a Dexterity (Stealth) check to escape but is still visible to the lead pursuer?", "answer": "The Dexterity (Stealth) check automatically fails if the quarry remains in sight of the lead pursuer."}
{"question": "How should a DM handle a chase if the quarry splits into multiple groups?", "answer": "The DM should resolve each chase separately, tracking distances individually for each group, although all participants can remain in the same Initiative order."}
{"question": "What happens during a 'Role Reversal' in a chase?", "answer": "The pursuers might become the quarry, or vice versa. This can happen if the quarry runs into allies or the pursuers attract unwanted attention. New participants roll Initiative, and both chases might run simultaneously."}
{"question": "What is the effect of failing the saving throw against an obstacle during an Urban Chase Complication?", "answer": "Typically, the obstacle counts as 10 feet of Difficult Terrain for the affected participant, slowing them down."}
{"question": "Can players proactively create complications during a chase?", "answer": "Yes, players can attempt to use actions, spells (like *Web*), or environmental interactions to create obstacles for their pursuers or quarry, subject to DM adjudication."}
{"question": "What types of abilities are typically suitable for a character's background?", "answer": "Backgrounds usually grant increases to three ability scores appropriate to the background's theme (e.g., Strength/Dexterity for physical labor, Intelligence/Wisdom for scholarly pursuits, Charisma for social roles)."}
{"question": "Can a character with a background focused on physical exertion choose Constitution for one of their background ability score increases?", "answer": "Yes, while Strength or Dexterity are listed as 'ideal' for physical exertion, the rules allow choosing any three appropriate abilities. Constitution (representing endurance) is often suitable for physically demanding backgrounds."}
{"question": "Can a DM freely change any ability score in a monster's stat block?", "answer": "Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma can often be changed without significantly impacting Challenge Rating (unless used for spellcasting). Changes to Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution should be made cautiously as they affect AC, attack/damage bonuses, and Hit Points, potentially altering the CR."}
{"question": "When modifying a creature's stat block, can its spells be replaced?", "answer": "Yes, you can generally replace a creature's spells with other spells of the same level, ideally keeping a similar function (e.g., replacing one damage spell with another)."}
{"question": "What restriction applies to the casting ability for the cantrip granted by the 'Wild Talent' sample creature trait?", "answer": "The creature must use Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability for that cantrip, chosen when the trait is applied."}
{"question": "Can a creature use the 'Ventriloquism' trait if no allies are nearby?", "answer": "The provided text for Ventriloquism states 'Whenever the creature speaks, it can choose a point within 30 feet of itself; its voice emanates from that point.' It does not mention requiring allies. (Note: This contradicts the user's previous Q&A pair, indicating a potential hallucination in the generator or misinterpretation in the previous review. The text itself is the authority here)." }
{"question": "Can altering a magic item's physical form change its rarity?", "answer": "No, changing an item's form (e.g., a Ring into a Wand) typically doesn't change its magical properties or rarity."}
{"question": "Can modifying a magic item include changing the type of damage it deals?", "answer": "Yes, for example, a *Flame Tongue* sword that deals Fire damage could be modified to deal Lightning damage instead."}
{"question": "What is a key indicator that a homebrewed spell might be too powerful for its intended level?", "answer": "If the spell is so effective or versatile that a caster would likely want to use it constantly over other options of the same level, it might be too strong (unbalanced)."}
{"question": "If a spell doesn't deal damage on a successful save, by how much can its damage on a failed save potentially be increased?", "answer": "The damage might be increased by up to 25 percent compared to a spell of the same level that deals half damage on a successful save."}
{"question": "What is a magical contagion?", "answer": "A magical contagion is a magically originating negative effect (like a disease or curse) that can spread from one creature to another."}
{"question": "How does the *Remove Curse* spell typically interact with Demonic Possession?", "answer": "Casting *Remove Curse* or *Dispel Evil and Good* on the possessed creature ends the Demonic Possession effect."}
{"question": "Does a creature possessed by a demon immediately regain control after failing a save?", "answer": "No. If the demon takes control (usually after the host rolls a 1 on a d20 test), the host must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw at the *end* of each of its subsequent turns to attempt to regain control."}
{"question": "What constitutes a 'fair' encounter design regarding unbeatable monsters?", "answer": "While it's acceptable to sometimes present monsters too powerful for the party to defeat directly, it's considered unfair if the players have no reasonable way to recognize the danger or no viable option to escape or avoid the fight."}

{"question": "How can a character increase their Renown score through downtime activities?", "answer": "By spending time between adventures undertaking minor tasks for the group and socializing with its members. Renown increases by 1 after spending a number of days equal to 10 times their current Renown score."}
{"question": "What is the minimum Renown score typically required to gain access to Uncommon magic items like Potions or Scrolls through an organization?", "answer": "A Renown score of 10 or higher often grants access to such perks."}
{"question": "Can a character's Renown score with a group drop below zero?", "answer": "No, a character's Renown score cannot drop below 0, even if they commit serious offenses against the group."}
{"question": "How can character level be used as an alternative to tracking Renown scores?", "answer": "The DM can use character level as a rough equivalent for Renown if the character has consistently worked with a specific group, using the Level-Based Renown table for benchmarks (e.g., level 5 ~ Renown 10, level 11 ~ Renown 25)."}
{"question": "Is a map always required when featuring a settlement in an adventure?", "answer": "No, a map isn't always necessary. Simple descriptions can suffice, but a map is helpful if the specific layout and locations of buildings are important for the adventure."}

It also provides alternatives if they miss or choose not to follow one particular path, preventing the adventure from stalling."}
{"question": "Which chapter typically contains descriptions and rules for magic items?", "answer": "Chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide (and sometimes the Player's Handbook for basic magic items) usually details magic items."}
{"question": "Can conflicts arise between non-villainous groups in an adventure?", "answer": "Yes, conflicts don't always involve clear good versus evil. Rivalries between families, guilds, or nations, or even disagreements within the adventuring party, can drive adventure plots."}
{"question": "How can a DM draw players into an adventure that doesn't directly involve their characters' personal stakes?", "answer": "By using hooks tailored to player/character motivations: offering rewards (gold, magic items, favors), appealing to heroism (pleas for help), involving patrons (quests from guilds, nobles, deities), or using supernatural signs (omens, dreams)."}

{"question": "What are the potential outcomes or functions of an encounter within an adventure?", "answer": "An encounter should either move characters closer to their goal, frustrate their progress, or reveal new, relevant information."}
{"question": "In a 'Run a Gauntlet' encounter, what is the primary objective compared to a typical combat encounter?", "answer": "In a 'Run a Gauntlet,' the main objective is to successfully navigate through a dangerous area to reach an exit, often prioritizing speed and survival over defeating every enemy encountered."}
{"question": "What can a DM do if players seem stuck or unsure how to proceed in an adventure?", "answer": "The DM can provide hints by reminding players of relevant information their characters already learned, prompting appropriate ability checks (like Intelligence checks) to help them connect clues, or introducing an NPC or event (like an 'Evil Intrusion') to guide them."}

{"question": "Why is it advisable to plan multiple ways for characters to succeed or progress through an adventure?", "answer": "To ensure the adventure doesn't stall if the characters fail a specific check, miss a clue, or choose an unexpected approach. Single points of failure should ideally lead to complications or detours, not dead ends."}
{"question": "Should challenges with only one specific solution be used in an adventure?", "answer": "Such challenges should generally be reserved for optional side objectives or opportunities for extra rewards, rather than being critical path requirements, to avoid frustrating players if they can't find the single solution."}
{"question": "Which chapter section provides guidance specifically for running exploration encounters?", "answer": "The 'Running Exploration' section in Chapter 2 of the Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) offers advice for handling exploration."}

{"question": "If a monster's treasure is themed (like Arcana, Armaments, etc.), how are magic items determined?", "answer": "The DM determines the number and rarity of magic items based on the hoard size (using the Random Treasure Hoard table) and then uses the magic item tables in DMG Chapter 7, often focusing on items matching the specified theme."}
{"question": "How should a DM adjust published adventure encounters if the player group is larger, smaller, higher-level, or lower-level than intended?", "answer": "The DM may need to add or remove monsters, increase or decrease monster HP, adjust tactics, or substitute different monsters to maintain the intended difficulty level for their specific party."}

{"question": "How can a campaign journal be used *during* a game session?", "answer": "The DM can use it to quickly look up forgotten details (like an NPC's name) or to jot down notes about things that happen spontaneously (like a new NPC or important clue) to incorporate later."}
{"question": "Is it necessary to use every adventure idea stored in a campaign journal's 'Adventure Stockpile'?", "answer": "No, the stockpile serves as a resource. Ideas can be used, modified, combined, or saved for later. Stand-alone adventures from the stockpile can also provide a change of pace in a serialized campaign."}
{"question": "What are the suggested character levels that mark transitions between the 'Tiers of Play' and serve as potential milestones for conflict arcs?", "answer": "The transitions typically occur around levels 5, 11, and 17, marking shifts in character power and the scope of campaign conflicts."}

{"question": "What benefits does a character gain from a Short Rest?", "answer": "During a Short Rest (at least 1 hour), a character can spend one or more Hit Dice to regain hit points. Some class features also recharge on a Short Rest (e.g., Warlock spell slots, Fighter's Action Surge)."}
{"question": "What benefits does a character gain from a Long Rest?", "answer": "During a Long Rest (at least 8 hours), a character regains all lost hit points, regains spent Hit Dice (up to half their maximum, minimum 1), and regains all expended spell slots (for most classes). Most features with daily uses also recharge."}
{"question": "What kinds of activities can interrupt a Long Rest and prevent its benefits?", "answer": "A Long Rest is interrupted by strenuous activity, such as fighting, casting spells (more than minor cantrips), walking for an hour or more, or taking watch for more than 2 hours. If interrupted, the character must restart the rest to gain any benefit."}
{"question": "What are the effects of Extreme Cold?", "answer": "A creature exposed to Extreme Cold must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain one level of Exhaustion. Creatures with resistance/immunity to cold damage or adapted to cold climates automatically succeed. Creatures wearing appropriate cold weather gear have Advantage."}
{"question": "What are the effects of Extreme Heat?", "answer": "A creature exposed to Extreme Heat must succeed on a DC 5 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour (DC increases by 1 for each previous hour) or gain one level of Exhaustion. Creatures adapted to hot climates have Advantage. Creatures wearing medium/heavy armor or heavy clothing have Disadvantage."}
{"question": "How is Injury poison typically applied?", "answer": "A creature can use an action (or sometimes a Bonus Action as specified by the poison) to apply Injury poison to a weapon or piece of ammunition. The poison remains potent until it deals damage through a wound or is washed off."}
{"question": "What might happen if two different magic potions are mixed together?", "answer": "Mixing potions is unpredictable. The effects might combine normally, one or both might be nullified, their potency/duration could be halved or doubled, one effect might become permanent, or the mixture could become poisonous or even explode. The DM usually determines the outcome, possibly using the Potion Miscibility table (DMG Ch 7)."}
{"question": "Can a character voluntarily end their Attunement to a cursed magic item?", "answer": "No, Attunement to a cursed item cannot be ended voluntarily. The curse must first be broken, typically using magic like the *Remove Curse* spell."}
{"question": "Can you use the Help action to grant Advantage to an ally's saving throw?", "answer": "No, the Help action can only be used to grant Advantage on an ability check or on the first attack roll an ally makes against a creature within 5 feet of you."}
{"question": "What happens if you attempt to take an action that has a prerequisite you don't meet?", "answer": "You cannot take an action if you don't meet its prerequisites. The action fails automatically with no effect."}
{"question": "If a spell description specifies a range of 'Self (15-foot radius sphere)', where does the sphere originate?", "answer": "The sphere originates from the caster, centered on them, and extends 15 feet in all directions."}
{"question": "Does total cover prevent spells with an area of effect, like Fireball, from affecting a creature behind it?", "answer": "No. While total cover prevents direct targeting, an area of effect spell can still affect creatures behind total cover if the area spreads around the cover to reach them (e.g., the sphere of a Fireball extends around a pillar)."}
{"question": "Can a spell component pouch replace a material component that has a gold piece cost listed?", "answer": "No. A component pouch or a spellcasting focus can only substitute for material components that do not have a specific cost listed in the spell description and are not consumed by the spell."}
{"question": "If a spell requires a somatic component, can you perform it while holding a weapon in one hand and a shield in the other?", "answer": "No, you need at least one free hand to perform somatic components. However, if the material component for the spell is provided by the hand holding the spellcasting focus (like a holy symbol on a shield), that same hand *can* perform the somatic components."}
{"question": "Can a spell like 'Guidance' (which adds a d4 bonus) be combined with the effect of the 'Bless' spell (which also adds a d4 bonus) on the same roll?", "answer": "No. When two effects grant a bonus from the same type of die (like a d4), they generally do not stack. The target would benefit from only one of the d4 bonuses on a given roll, typically the most recently applied or the one they choose if applied simultaneously."}
{"question": "If a creature fails a saving throw against an ongoing effect (like being Frightened) and the effect allows a new save at the end of each turn, does taking damage grant another immediate saving throw?", "answer": "No, unless the specific effect states otherwise (like Concentration saves). The creature typically only gets to make the saving throw at the end of its turn as specified by the effect."}
{"question": "When attacking with a net, do you make a Strength or Dexterity based attack roll?", "answer": "Attacking with a net does not use a standard attack roll. Instead, the target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 + your Dex modifier + your proficiency bonus) or be restrained."}
{"question": "What size creature can be targeted by a net?", "answer": "A net can target a creature of size Large or smaller. Huge or Gargantuan creatures automatically succeed on the saving throw to avoid being restrained by a standard net."}
{"question": "If you use the Attack action to Shove a creature, what are the possible outcomes?", "answer": "On a successful Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics), you can either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away from you."}
{"question": "Can you Shove a creature more than one size larger than you?", "answer": "No, the target of a Shove must be no more than one size larger than you."}
{"question": "What happens when you try to Hide while you are only Lightly Obscured?", "answer": "You can attempt to hide when you are Lightly Obscured, but whether you remain hidden depends on the DM's judgment of the situation and potentially requires a Dexterity (Stealth) check contested by observers' Wisdom (Perception). You can't hide from a creature that can see you clearly."}
{"question": "After successfully Hiding, what causes you to become revealed?", "answer": "You are revealed if you move out of cover or the obscured area, make noise, or make an attack. Making an attack reveals you immediately after the attack hits or misses."}
{"question": "If you take the Ready action to cast a spell, do you cast the spell on your turn or when the trigger occurs?", "answer": "You cast the spell on your turn, expending the spell slot, but hold its energy. You then use your Reaction to release the spell when the specified trigger occurs. You must maintain Concentration on the held spell."}
{"question": "What happens if you lose Concentration while holding a spell readied with the Ready action?", "answer": "If your Concentration is broken before you release the spell with your Reaction, the spell dissipates harmlessly, and the spell slot is lost."}
{"question": "Can you use the Search action to determine if someone is lying?", "answer": "Yes. The Search action allows you to make a Wisdom (Insight) check to attempt to determine the true intentions of a creature, such as discerning whether they are telling the truth or trying to deceive you."}
{"question": "What ability check might be required to navigate difficult terrain while traveling overland?", "answer": "The DM might call for a Wisdom (Survival) check to navigate and avoid getting lost, especially in terrain without clear paths or landmarks, or during bad weather. The DC depends on the terrain."}
{"question": "How much food and water does a typical character need per day?", "answer": "A character typically needs one pound of food and one gallon of water per day, or twice that in hot weather."}
{"question": "What happens if a character goes without food?", "answer": "A character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + their Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the end of each day beyond that limit, they automatically suffer one level of Exhaustion."}
{"question": "What happens if a character goes without water?", "answer": "A character needs at least one gallon of water per day (two in hot weather). If they drink only half the required amount, they must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of Exhaustion. If they drink less than half, they automatically suffer one level of Exhaustion."}
{"question": "How does the Foraging activity work during travel?", "answer": "While traveling at a Normal or Slow pace, characters can attempt to forage. Each character foraging makes a Wisdom (Survival) check (DC based on terrain). On a success, they find 1d6 + Wisdom modifier pounds of food and gallons of water."}
{"question": "What is the effect of Suffocation?", "answer": "A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum 30 seconds). When it runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 HP and is dying, and cannot regain HP or be stabilized until it can breathe again."}
{"question": "Can you use Calligrapher's Supplies to forge a document?", "answer": "While Calligrapher's Supplies can be used to mimic handwriting (with a check), successfully forging a document typically requires proficiency with a Forgery Kit and involves checks like Intelligence (History) for historical accuracy or Charisma (Deception) to pass it off."}
{"question": "What benefit does proficiency with Cook's Utensils provide when making Rations?", "answer": "While anyone can try to preserve food, proficiency with Cook's Utensils likely grants Advantage on checks related to preparing high-quality, long-lasting rations or identifying edible components."}
{"question": "Can you use Tinker's Tools to create a complex device instantly?", "answer": "No. While proficiency might allow crafting simple items or attempting repairs, creating complex devices usually follows the standard crafting rules requiring significant time and cost. The 'Utilize' action might allow creating a very temporary, jury-rigged Tiny item."}
{"question": "What ability check is typically used for picking a lock or disarming a trap with Thieves' Tools?", "answer": "Picking locks or disarming mechanical traps usually requires a Dexterity check made with Thieves' Tools proficiency."}
{"question": "How much weight can an animal pulling a cart or wagon move?", "answer": "An animal pulling a vehicle can move weight up to five times its base carrying capacity, including the weight of the vehicle itself."}
{"question": "What is Barding?", "answer": "Barding is armor specifically designed and fitted for a mount, such as a horse or warhorse. It typically costs four times and weighs twice as much as the equivalent armor for a humanoid."}
{"question": "What is the benefit of using a Military Saddle?", "answer": "A Military Saddle provides the rider with Advantage on any ability check or saving throw made to remain mounted."}
{"question": "What is the typical cost for passage on a sailing ship?", "answer": "Passage on a ship typically costs around 1 SP per mile, though this can vary."}
{"question": "What is the difference between a Skilled and an Untrained hireling?", "answer": "A Skilled hireling is hired for tasks requiring a specific proficiency (skill, tool, weapon) and costs more (typically 2 GP/day). An Untrained hireling performs general labor without specific skills and costs less (typically 2 SP/day)."}
{"question": "Can you typically purchase spellcasting services for spells above 5th level in a small town?", "answer": "No. Spellcasting services for 6th-level spells and higher are usually only available in large cities, and finding casters capable of 9th-level spells is extremely rare even there."}
{"question": "How long must a character focus on a magic item to learn its properties without using the Identify spell?", "answer": "A character must spend a Short Rest (at least 1 hour) focusing on the item while in physical contact with it."}
{"question": "Can a character be attuned to two identical magic items, like two Rings of Protection?", "answer": "No, a character cannot attune to more than one copy of the same magic item simultaneously."}
{"question": "How can Attunement to a magic item end?", "answer": "Attunement ends if the character no longer meets prerequisites, if the item is more than 100 feet away for 24 hours, if the character dies, if another creature attunes to it, or if the character voluntarily spends a Short Rest to end it (unless the item is cursed)."}
{"question": "What happens if you wear only one item from a magical pair, like one Boot of Elvenkind?", "answer": "You gain no magical benefit. Paired magic items generally require both items of the pair to be worn to function."}
{"question": "What proficiency is typically required to craft magic items in general (besides specific tool proficiency)?", "answer": "Crafting most magic items requires proficiency in the Arcana skill."}
{"question": "If a magic item allows casting a spell, does the character crafting it need to know that spell?", "answer": "Yes, the character crafting the item must typically have the spell prepared (or known) for each day spent working on the item."}
{"question": "How is the time required to craft a non-consumable magic item calculated?", "answer": "The time in workdays (8 hours/day) is generally the item's base market cost in GP divided by 50, adjusted by rarity (DMG Ch 7 / XGtE for specifics). The 2024 DMG Ch 7 table simplifies this based on rarity (e.g., 10 days for Uncommon, 50 days for Rare)."}
{"question": "How is the cost of raw materials determined when crafting a magic item?", "answer": "The cost of raw materials is typically half the item's base market value, as listed by rarity (e.g., 200 GP for Uncommon, 2,000 GP for Rare). This is in addition to the cost of any nonmagical base item (like a sword for a magic sword)."}
{"question": "Can multiple characters work together to craft a magic item faster?", "answer": "Yes, characters assisting the primary crafter (who must also have relevant proficiencies) can reduce the total crafting time. The time is divided by the number of collaborating characters (DM determines limit, often 1 assistant)." }
{"question": "What check determines if a Wizard scribing a spell scroll successfully creates it?", "answer": "There isn't typically a check. If the Wizard meets the prerequisites (proficiency, spell prepared, time, cost, components), they successfully create the scroll."}
{"question": "Can a creature voluntarily squeeze through a space that is smaller than its size category?", "answer": "Yes, a creature can squeeze through a space large enough for a creature one size smaller than itself. While squeezing, the creature spends 1 extra foot for every foot it moves, and it has Disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws."}
{"question": "How does moving through a space occupied by a non-hostile creature (an ally) affect your movement?", "answer": "You can move through a non-hostile creature's space. It counts as difficult terrain only if the creature is not Tiny. You cannot willingly end your move in its space."}
{"question": "If you have both a Swim speed and a regular walking speed, how is movement calculated when swimming?", "answer": "If you have a Swim speed, you use that speed for swimming and do not need to spend extra movement. If you lack a Swim speed, each foot of movement while swimming costs 1 extra foot (or more in rough water)."}
{"question": "What is the maximum number of creatures whose effects can be active simultaneously when using a Bag of Tricks?", "answer": "Only one creature can be drawn from a Bag of Tricks at a time. If a creature is already active outside the bag, drawing another causes the first one to disappear."}
{"question": "Can the light created by the *Light* cantrip be dispelled by magical darkness?", "answer": "No. If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of darkness created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the darkness is dispelled. It cannot dispel darkness created by higher-level spells."}
{"question": "What happens if you target a creature behind total cover with a spell like *Magic Missile* that normally hits automatically?", "answer": "The spell fails because you must have a clear path to the target (line of effect) for most spells, even those that don't require an attack roll. Total cover blocks line of effect."}
{"question": "If a spell requires concentration, can you choose to end the spell early?", "answer": "Yes, you can choose to end concentration on a spell at any time, requiring no action."}
{"question": "Can you use a reaction to cast a spell if you have already cast a bonus action spell on your turn?", "answer": "Yes. The rule restricting spellcasting applies only to casting spells with spell slots using your Action if you cast a Bonus Action spell. Reactions occur outside this restriction."}
{"question": "If an effect grants temporary hit points, do they stack with temporary hit points from another source?", "answer": "No, temporary hit points do not stack. If you have temporary hit points and gain more, you decide whether to keep the current amount or take the new amount."}
{"question": "What happens to any remaining temporary hit points when you finish a long rest?", "answer": "Unless their duration specifies otherwise, temporary hit points are lost when you finish a long rest."}
{"question": "When making a Strength (Athletics) check to Shove a creature, what size limitations apply to the target?", "answer": "The target of your Shove must be no more than one size larger than you."}
{"question": "Does taking the Dodge action prevent you from being hit by attacks?", "answer": "No. The Dodge action imposes Disadvantage on attack rolls made against you and grants you Advantage on Dexterity saving throws until the start of your next turn. It does not guarantee attacks will miss."}
{"question": "If you ready an action to attack when an enemy moves, and multiple enemies move, can you attack all of them?", "answer": "No. A Readied action uses your Reaction, and you only get one Reaction per round. You can use your Reaction to attack the first enemy that triggers your readied condition, but then your Reaction is spent."}
{"question": "Can you use the Help action to assist someone with a skill check if you are not proficient in that skill yourself?", "answer": "Yes. You don't need proficiency in the skill yourself to use the Help action to grant an ally Advantage on their ability check, as long as you could reasonably assist them."}
{"question": "How does interacting with an object work during combat?", "answer": "You can interact with one object or environmental feature for free during your turn (either during movement or your action), such as drawing a sword or opening a door. Interacting with a second object requires taking the Utilize action."}
{"question": "What are the specific effects of the second level of Exhaustion?", "answer": "At Exhaustion level 2, a creature's speed is halved."}
{"question": "What are the effects of the fifth level of Exhaustion?", "answer": "At Exhaustion level 5, a creature's speed is reduced to 0."}
{"question": "How can levels of Exhaustion be removed?", "answer": "Finishing a Long Rest reduces a creature's exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink. Certain magical effects, like the *Greater Restoration* spell, can also reduce exhaustion."}
{"question": "Can you gain the benefits of a Long Rest if it is interrupted by combat?", "answer": "No. A Long Rest must be at least 8 hours long and is interrupted if a character engages in strenuous activity like fighting for 1 hour or more. If interrupted, the rest provides no benefit, and must be started again."}
{"question": "How many Hit Dice does a character regain after finishing a Long Rest?", "answer": "A character regains spent Hit Dice equal to half of their maximum number of Hit Dice (minimum of one die), rounded down."}
{"question": "Does a natural 1 on an ability check or saving throw automatically mean failure?", "answer": "No. Unlike attack rolls, rolling a 1 on an ability check or saving throw does not have any special effect; the total result (d20 + modifiers) is simply compared to the DC."}
{"question": "Does a natural 20 on an ability check or saving throw automatically mean success?", "answer": "No. While a natural 20 on an attack roll is a critical hit, a natural 20 on an ability check or saving throw is simply a high roll. The total (20 + modifiers) must still meet or exceed the DC to succeed. The DM might grant additional benefits on a natural 20, but it's not automatic success against impossible DCs."}
{"question": "What is the maximum number of attuned items listed on the standard character sheet?", "answer": "The standard character sheet typically has space to list three attuned magic items, reflecting the rule that a character can normally attune to no more than three items at once."}
{"question": "What happens if you try to cast a spell without the required material component (and cannot substitute a focus)?", "answer": "You cannot cast the spell. All required components must be provided for a spell to be cast successfully."}
{"question": "Can a Bard use their musical instrument as a spellcasting focus for spells learned through Magical Secrets if those spells are not on the Bard spell list?", "answer": "Generally, yes. A spellcasting focus can be used for any spell cast using the spellcasting ability associated with that focus (Charisma for Bards), regardless of the spell's original list, unless a specific rule or item says otherwise."}
{"question": "What is the typical weight of common coins like GP, SP, or CP?", "answer": "Fifty coins of any type weigh approximately 1 pound."}
{"question": "If an effect gives you a 'bonus to AC', does this stack with wearing armor?", "answer": "Yes. Bonuses to AC (e.g., from a *Ring of Protection* or the *Shield of Faith* spell) stack with the AC granted by armor and shields, unless the bonus specifies it doesn't work with armor."}
{"question": "What happens if you are Grappled and then knocked Prone?", "answer": "You have both the Grappled condition (speed 0) and the Prone condition (disadvantage on attacks, advantage/disadvantage on attacks against you based on range). You cannot stand up from Prone until the Grappled condition ends, as standing up costs movement and your speed is 0."}
{"question": "If a creature is Invisible, can it still be heard?", "answer": "Yes. The Invisible condition only makes a creature impossible to see without special means. It does not make them silent. Creatures might still detect an invisible creature by hearing it move or speak."}
{"question": "Can you make an Opportunity Attack against an Invisible creature that leaves your reach?", "answer": "Yes, provided you can somehow sense it leaving your reach (e.g., hearing it). However, the attack roll against the invisible creature would have Disadvantage because you cannot see it."}
{"question": "What proficiency allows a character to add their proficiency bonus to checks made to navigate using the stars?", "answer": "Proficiency with Navigator's Tools allows adding the proficiency bonus to Wisdom checks made to navigate by the stars."}
{"question": "Can Alchemist's Supplies be used to create a Potion of Healing?", "answer": "Yes, the optional crafting rules allow creating a Potion of Healing using either Alchemist's Supplies or an Herbalism Kit, requiring 1 day and 25 GP of materials."}
{"question": "What is required to scribe a Spell Scroll?", "answer": "The caster needs proficiency in Arcana or Calligrapher's Supplies, must have the spell prepared (or known), must provide any costly/consumed material components, and must spend the time and gold cost based on the spell's level."}
{"question": "Does casting a spell from a Spell Scroll consume the scroll?", "answer": "Yes. When the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and it crumbles to dust."}
{"question": "If you have the War Caster feat, can you perform somatic components even with weapons or shields in both hands?", "answer": "Yes, the War Caster feat explicitly allows you to perform the somatic components of spells even when you have weapons or a shield in one or both hands."}
{"question": "What advantage does the War Caster feat provide for maintaining concentration?", "answer": "It grants Advantage on Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration on a spell when you take damage."}
{"question": "What kind of attack can you make as a reaction using the War Caster feat?", "answer": "When a hostile creature's movement provokes an opportunity attack from you, you can use your reaction to cast a spell at the creature, rather than making an opportunity attack. The spell must have a casting time of 1 action and must target only that creature."}
{"question": "What does the Shield Master feat allow you to do as a bonus action?", "answer": "If you take the Attack action on your turn, the Shield Master feat allows you to use a Bonus Action to try to Shove a creature within 5 feet of you with your shield."}
{"question": "What benefit does the Shield Master feat provide against spells forcing Dexterity saves?", "answer": "If you aren't Incapacitated, you can add your shield's AC bonus to any Dexterity saving throw you make against a spell or other harmful effect that targets only you. If you succeed on the save against an effect that would deal half damage on success, you can use your reaction to take no damage instead, interposing your shield."}
{"question": "Can the bonus action granted by the Polearm Master feat be used if you didn't attack with the polearm?", "answer": "No. The bonus action attack (using the opposite end) requires you to have taken the Attack action and attacked *only* with the eligible polearm (glaive, halberd, quarterstaff, or spear) that turn."}
{"question": "What triggers the reaction attack granted by the Polearm Master feat?", "answer": "You can make an opportunity attack with the polearm when a creature *enters* your reach while you are wielding it (not just when they leave)."}
{"question": "What is the benefit of the Sharpshooter feat regarding range?", "answer": "Attacking at long range doesn't impose Disadvantage on your ranged weapon attack rolls."}
{"question": "What benefit does the Sharpshooter feat provide regarding cover?", "answer": "Your ranged weapon attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover."}
{"question": "What trade-off does the Sharpshooter feat offer for damage?", "answer": "Before you make an attack with a ranged weapon you are proficient with, you can choose to take a -5 penalty to the attack roll. If the attack hits, you add +10 to the attack's damage."}
{"question": "What is the benefit of the Great Weapon Master feat regarding critical hits or reducing a creature to 0 HP?", "answer": "On your turn, when you score a critical hit with a melee weapon or reduce a creature to 0 hit points with one, you can make one melee weapon attack as a bonus action."}
{"question": "What trade-off does the Great Weapon Master feat offer for damage?", "answer": "Before you make a melee attack with a heavy weapon you are proficient with, you can choose to take a -5 penalty to the attack roll. If the attack hits, you add +10 to the attack's damage."}
{"question": "What is required to make a high jump or a long jump?", "answer": "Jumping is part of your movement. To make a high jump or long jump, you must have movement remaining. The distance you can jump is based on your Strength score and whether you have a running start (at least 10 feet of movement immediately before the jump)."}
{"question": "Does jumping provoke an opportunity attack if you jump out of an enemy's reach?", "answer": "Yes. Jumping uses your movement, so if your jump takes you out of a hostile creature's reach, it provokes an opportunity attack just like regular movement would."}
{"question": "What happens if you don't have enough movement left to cover the full distance of your intended jump?", "answer": "You cannot jump farther than your remaining movement allows. If your calculated jump distance exceeds your remaining movement, your jump ends when you run out of movement."}
{"question": "Can you use the Disengage action and then use your movement to jump away from an enemy without provoking an opportunity attack?", "answer": "Yes. The Disengage action prevents your movement from provoking opportunity attacks for the rest of that turn, which includes movement used for jumping."}
{"question": "When using the Search action, what skill is typically used to spot a hidden creature or object?", "answer": "The Search action typically involves making a Wisdom (Perception) check to find hidden creatures or objects by noticing subtle clues through sight, sound, or smell."}
{"question": "When using the Search action, what skill is typically used to deduce the location of a hidden object based on physical evidence (e.g., scrape marks, mechanism analysis)?", "answer": "The Search action can involve making an Intelligence (Investigation) check when actively looking for clues and making deductions based on evidence, such as figuring out how a secret door mechanism works."}
{"question": "What is the difference between Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Deception)?", "answer": "Wisdom (Insight) is used to determine the true intentions of a creature, sensing emotions, detecting lies, or predicting someone's next move. Charisma (Deception) is used to convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through actions, such as telling a lie or using a disguise effectively."}
{"question": "Can you use the 'Utilize' action to interact with a magic item?", "answer": "No. The Utilize action is specifically for interacting with nonmagical objects. Activating or using the properties of a magic item typically requires taking the Magic action, unless the item's description specifies otherwise (like drinking a potion being a Bonus Action)."}
{"question": "If a character has a burrow speed, can they typically move through solid rock?", "answer": "Not usually. A burrow speed allows movement through sand, earth, mud, or ice. Moving through solid rock typically requires a special monster trait or magical ability explicitly stating so."}
{"question": "What happens if an effect forces a creature to move into a hazardous area, like a Wall of Fire?", "answer": "If an effect moves a creature into a hazard's area against its will, the creature is typically subject to the hazard's effects immediately (e.g., taking damage from the Wall of Fire)."}
{"question": "Can you use a reaction on your own turn?", "answer": "Yes. Reactions can be taken in response to a trigger, and that trigger can occur on your own turn or someone else's turn. However, you still only get one reaction per round."}
{"question": "What happens if you ready a spell that requires concentration and then take damage before your reaction trigger occurs?", "answer": "You must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on the readied spell. If you fail the save, the spell slot is lost, and the spell dissipates without effect."}
{"question": "Can a creature with 0 hit points benefit from temporary hit points?", "answer": "Yes, a creature at 0 HP can receive temporary hit points. However, temporary HP do not restore consciousness or stabilize the creature; they only act as a buffer against further damage that might cause death saving throw failures."}
{"question": "Does Force damage typically bypass resistance or immunity?", "answer": "Force damage is a distinct type of magical energy. Creatures rarely have resistance or immunity to Force damage unless their description specifically grants it. It is not automatically bypassed by default."}
{"question": "If you are hidden from a creature, do you gain advantage on ability checks made against it, like Intimidation or Deception?", "answer": "No. Being hidden grants Advantage on *attack rolls* against a creature that can't see you. It doesn't typically grant Advantage on ability checks, although the DM might grant circumstantial Advantage if being hidden aids the specific check (e.g., hiding helps a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check)."}
{"question": "What activities can a character engage in during a Short Rest without interrupting it?", "answer": "During a Short Rest, a character can perform light activities such as eating, drinking, reading, tending to wounds (including spending Hit Dice), and keeping watch. Strenuous activity like fighting or casting spells (other than cantrips) interrupts the rest."}
{"question": "What happens if a character attempts a Long Rest but is interrupted by combat lasting less than an hour?", "answer": "If the interruption involves less than 1 hour of strenuous activity (like fighting or spellcasting), the character can resume the Long Rest afterward. The time spent resting before the interruption counts towards the total 8 hours needed."}
{"question": "Can you cast a spell that targets 'a creature you can see' if the target is behind a clear window?", "answer": "No. A clear window provides total cover, which blocks the line of effect needed for most spells, even if you have line of sight."}
{"question": "How does the Subtle Spell metamagic option interact with spell components?", "answer": "Subtle Spell allows a Sorcerer to cast a spell without providing any somatic (S) or verbal (V) components, making the casting potentially unnoticeable."}
{"question": "If a spell has both Verbal and Somatic components, can you cast it while silenced but with free hands?", "answer": "No. If a spell requires a component, you must provide it. Being silenced prevents providing the Verbal component, so the spell cannot be cast, even if you can perform the Somatic component."}
{"question": "What type of armor imposes disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks?", "answer": "Certain types of Medium armor (Scale Mail, Half Plate) and all types of Heavy armor (Ring Mail, Chain Mail, Splint, Plate) impose Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks."}
{"question": "Can you benefit from wearing more than one shield?", "answer": "No, a creature can only benefit from one shield at a time."}
{"question": "If you use the Attack action to make multiple attacks (due to Extra Attack), can you move between those attacks?", "answer": "Yes. You can break up your movement during your turn, taking some movement before your first attack, some between attacks, and some after your last attack, as long as you don't exceed your total speed for the turn."}
{"question": "What happens if you try to grapple a creature that is two or more sizes larger than you?", "answer": "The grapple attempt automatically fails. You can only attempt to grapple creatures that are no more than one size larger than you."}
{"question": "Can you gain proficiency with a tool through training during downtime?", "answer": "Yes, the PHB suggests that training with a suitable instructor over a period of time (often 250 days and 1 GP per day, though DMs can adjust) can grant proficiency with a tool or language."}
{"question": "What is the typical result of failing a Strength (Athletics) check to break open a barred door?", "answer": "Simply failing the check means the door remains barred. The DM might rule that failing by a large amount alerts nearby creatures due to the noise, or potentially damages the character's tools if applicable."}
{"question": "If an effect gives a bonus to 'weapon attacks,' does it apply to spell attacks?", "answer": "No. 'Weapon attacks' specifically refer to attacks made with melee or ranged weapons (including unarmed strikes). Effects applying to 'spell attacks' are specified separately."}
{"question": "Does the damage from the Hex spell double on a critical hit?", "answer": "Yes. *Hex* adds an extra d6 damage die to the attack's damage roll. Since all damage dice are rolled twice on a critical hit, the d6 from *Hex* would also be rolled twice."}
{"question": "If you are Incapacitated, can you maintain Concentration on a spell?", "answer": "No. The Incapacitated condition prevents a creature from taking actions or reactions. Losing the ability to take actions also breaks concentration."}
{"question": "What is the difference between half cover and three-quarters cover?", "answer": "Half cover grants a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. Three-quarters cover grants a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. Total cover prevents direct targeting."}
{"question": "Can you gain cover from another creature?", "answer": "Yes, a creature, whether friendly or hostile, can provide half cover if it's between you and the source of an attack or effect, provided it covers at least half of you."}
{"question": "If you are behind full cover but lean out to make a ranged attack, do you still have cover?", "answer": "When you make the attack, you must expose yourself enough to see the target, losing the benefit of total cover and typically gaining half cover or potentially no cover relative to that target at the moment of the attack, as determined by the DM."}
{"question": "Does darkness impose disadvantage on attack rolls?", "answer": "Yes. Darkness creates a heavily obscured area. When you attack a target you can't see (because it's in darkness or for another reason), you have disadvantage on the attack roll."}
{"question": "If both the attacker and the target are in complete darkness and lack darkvision, what happens to attack rolls?", "answer": "The attacker has Disadvantage (because they can't see the target) and the target effectively grants the attacker Advantage (because the target can't see the attacker). These cancel out, resulting in a straight roll, unless other circumstances apply."}
{"question": "What happens if you try to cast a spell with a range of 'Touch' on a creature just outside your reach?", "answer": "The spell fails. To cast a Touch spell, the target must be within your reach when you cast the spell."}
{"question": "Can you cast a touch spell through a familiar?", "answer": "Yes, if you have the Find Familiar spell, when you cast a spell with a range of Touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast the spell, using its reaction to do so when it is within 100 feet of you."}
{"question": "How long does a creature typically remain poisoned from a single dose of basic poison applied to a weapon?", "answer": "Basic poison applied to a weapon deals extra damage on the first hit within 1 minute and has no further effect. Other poisons specify their duration or the saving throw needed to end the poisoned condition."}
{"question": "If a feature allows you to make an extra attack when you take the Attack action, can you use that extra attack for something other than attacking, like grappling or shoving?", "answer": "Yes. Grappling and Shoving are special melee attacks that replace one of your attacks when you take the Attack action. If you have the Extra Attack feature, you can replace one or more of those attacks with a grapple or shove attempt."}
{"question": "What happens if you are underwater and run out of breath?", "answer": "You can survive for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round) while choking. At the start of your next turn after that, you drop to 0 Hit Points, are dying, and cannot regain HP or be stabilized until you can breathe."}
{"question": "Can you hold your breath indefinitely while underwater if you have a means of breathing water (like a Water Breathing spell)?", "answer": "If you can breathe underwater, you don't need to hold your breath and are not at risk of suffocating from being submerged."}
{"question": "What is the difference between passive Perception and an active Perception check?", "answer": "Passive Perception represents general awareness without active effort, used by the DM to see if characters notice things automatically. An active Wisdom (Perception) check represents a character deliberately trying to perceive something specific, requiring an action (usually the Search action)."}
{"question": "What check might be needed to identify a spell currently affecting a creature or object?", "answer": "A character can use their action to make an Intelligence (Arcana) check to identify an ongoing magical effect or spell they perceive, typically against a DC of 15 + the spell's level."}
{"question": "Can you identify a potion by tasting it?", "answer": "Yes, the rules state that tasting a potion is enough to determine its effect."}
{"question": "Can a spell require multiple saving throws from a target?", "answer": "Yes. Some spells might require an initial saving throw to avoid an effect, and then allow further saving throws on subsequent turns to end an ongoing effect (like *Hold Person*). Other spells might target multiple abilities simultaneously, forcing separate saves (though this is rare)."}
{"question": "What does it mean when a spell description says a component is consumed?", "answer": "If a material component is listed as being consumed, that specific item is destroyed or used up during the casting and must be provided anew each time the spell is cast. A spellcasting focus or component pouch cannot replace consumed components."}
{"question": "If a spell has a duration of 'Concentration, up to 1 minute', can the caster choose to end it after 3 rounds?", "answer": "Yes, the caster can choose to end their concentration on a spell at any time (no action required), ending the spell's effects prematurely."}
{"question": "Can you prepare spells from a class you multiclassed into if your spell slots are only from your primary class?", "answer": "Yes. You determine which spells you can prepare separately for each class based on your level in *that class*. You use the combined spell slots (calculated using the multiclassing rules) to cast any spell you have prepared, regardless of which class prepared it."}
{"question": "If you are a multiclass Paladin/Sorcerer, which ability score do you use for the spell save DC of your Paladin spells vs your Sorcerer spells?", "answer": "You use Charisma for both, as Charisma is the spellcasting ability for both Paladins and Sorcerers. If you multiclassed classes with different spellcasting abilities (e.g., Cleric/Wizard), you would use Wisdom for Cleric spells and Intelligence for Wizard spells."}
{"question": "Can you use the Attack action to attack with a weapon and then cast a cantrip as a bonus action on the same turn?", "answer": "Only if you have a specific feature or spell that allows casting a cantrip as a bonus action. Normally, casting a cantrip requires the Magic action, which you cannot take if you already took the Attack action (unless you use Action Surge, etc.)."}
{"question": "What happens to your movement speed if you are dragging a grappled creature?", "answer": "Your speed is halved when moving and dragging or carrying a creature you have grappled, unless that creature is two or more sizes smaller than you."}
{"question": "If a creature has resistance to nonmagical bludgeoning damage, does it also resist damage from falling?", "answer": "No. Falling damage is bludgeoning damage, but it is not explicitly categorized as nonmagical weapon damage. Resistance to 'bludgeoning damage from nonmagical attacks' generally only applies to weapon attacks, not environmental sources like falling, unless the DM rules otherwise."}
{"question": "Can you add your Dexterity modifier to the damage of a thrown weapon like a dagger or handaxe?", "answer": "Only if the weapon has the Finesse property (like a dagger). For thrown weapons without Finesse (like a handaxe), you use Strength for the attack and damage rolls, even though it's a ranged attack."}
{"question": "What is required to use the Nick weapon mastery property?", "answer": "You must be wielding two different light melee weapons, take the Attack action, and attack with one of them. The Nick property allows the bonus attack with the other light weapon to be part of the Attack action instead of requiring a separate Bonus Action (but only once per turn)."}
{"question": "What does the Vex weapon mastery property do?", "answer": "If you hit a creature and deal damage with a weapon using the Vex property, you gain Advantage on your next attack roll made against that same creature before the end of your next turn."}
{"question": "Does proficiency with light armor grant proficiency with shields?", "answer": "No. Proficiency with shields is separate from proficiency with light, medium, or heavy armor categories."}
{"question": "What is the carrying capacity of a creature typically based on?", "answer": "A creature's carrying capacity (the maximum weight they can carry) is usually 15 times their Strength score in pounds."}
{"question": "What is the rule for pushing, dragging, or lifting weight beyond your carrying capacity?", "answer": "You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength score). While doing so, your speed drops to 5 feet."}
{"question": "How is the cost of spellcasting services determined for spells with expensive material components?", "answer": "The cost listed for spellcasting services is in addition to the cost of any material components that the spell consumes or that have a specific gold piece value listed."}
{"question": "Can you learn how to use a magic item's command word by focusing on it during a short rest?", "answer": "Yes. Focusing on an item during a short rest allows you to learn all its properties, including how to activate them, which would include any command words."}
{"question": "What happens if you attempt to attune to a magic item but the short rest is interrupted?", "answer": "The attunement attempt fails. You must complete an uninterrupted short rest while focusing on the item to successfully attune to it."}
{"question": "Can you interact with more than one object for free on your turn if you use the Utilize action?", "answer": "No. You get one free object interaction during your move or action. Any subsequent interactions with objects on the same turn require you to take the Utilize action for each additional interaction."}
{"question": "If you cast a spell with a casting time of 1 Bonus Action, can you still use your regular Action for something non-magical, like the Attack action?", "answer": "Yes. The restriction only applies to casting *other spells* with spell slots. If you cast a Bonus Action spell, you can still use your Action to Attack, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, Help, Hide, Influence, Search, Study, or Utilize."}
{"question": "What is the rule for targeting a creature that is underwater with a spell?", "answer": "Most spells work normally underwater, provided the caster or target has a way to breathe. However, spells requiring a ranged attack roll might have disadvantage unless the caster has a swim speed. Spells creating fire might function differently or fail, subject to DM discretion."}
{"question": "How does the Ready action interact with the Extra Attack feature?", "answer": "When you use the Ready action to make an attack as your reaction, you only make a single attack, regardless of whether you have the Extra Attack feature. Extra Attack only applies when you take the Attack action on your turn."}
{"question": "Can you use a Reaction when you are Surprised?", "answer": "No. If you are surprised, you cannot take an action or a reaction on your first turn of the combat. You regain your reaction at the end of that turn."}
{"question": "What does it mean for a spell or effect to require line of sight?", "answer": "Line of sight means you must be able to see the target or the intended point of origin for the effect. Total cover typically blocks line of sight."}
{"question": "If an area of effect originates from a point you choose within range, does that point need to be visible?", "answer": "Yes, you must typically have line of sight to the point you choose as the origin of an area of effect spell like *Fireball*."}
{"question": "Can you make a melee attack against a target if an ally is directly between you and the target?", "answer": "Generally, yes. An ally doesn't provide cover against melee attacks. However, the DM might rule that a particularly crowded situation imposes disadvantage or makes the attack impossible."}
{"question": "What are the specific rules for using Ball Bearings from adventuring gear?", "answer": "As an action (Utilize), you spill them in a 10-foot square area. A creature entering the area must make a DC 10 Dexterity save or fall prone. It takes 1 minute to recover them."}
{"question": "How are Caltrops used in combat?", "answer": "As an action (Utilize), you spread them in a 5-foot square. A creature entering the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity save or stop moving, take 1 piercing damage, and have its speed reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn."}
{"question": "How does Acid (vial) function as an attack?", "answer": "As an action (replacing one attack), you throw it up to 20 feet. The target makes a Dexterity save (DC 8 + Dex mod + Prof Bonus) or takes 2d6 Acid damage."}
{"question": "How does Holy Water function against Fiends or Undead?", "answer": "As an action (replacing one attack), you throw it up to 20 feet. A Fiend or Undead target makes a Dexterity save (DC 8 + Dex mod + Prof Bonus) or takes 2d8 Radiant damage."}
{"question": "How is a Hunting Trap set and what does it do?", "answer": "As an action (Utilize), you set the trap, which snaps shut on a creature stepping on its pressure plate. The creature makes a DC 13 Dexterity save or takes 1d4 piercing damage and has its speed reduced to 0 until freed (DC 13 Strength check as an action, takes 1 damage on fail)." }
{"question": "What happens if you move into the space of a creature that is two sizes larger than you?", "answer": "You can move through the space of a creature two or more sizes larger or smaller than you. That creature's space counts as difficult terrain for you."}
{"question": "How much movement does it cost to stand up from the Prone condition?", "answer": "Standing up costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. You cannot stand up if you don't have enough movement left or if your speed is 0."}
{"question": "If an effect reduces your maximum hit points, can healing restore hit points above the reduced maximum?", "answer": "No. A creature's hit points cannot exceed its current maximum hit points, even if that maximum has been temporarily reduced."}
{"question": "How can hit point maximum reduction typically be removed?", "answer": "Hit point maximum reduction usually lasts until a creature finishes a Long Rest or receives specific magical healing capable of removing the effect, such as the *Greater Restoration* spell."}
{"question": "Can you identify the properties of a cursed magic item by focusing on it during a short rest?", "answer": "No. Focusing on an item during a short rest reveals its magical properties and how to use them, but it does not reveal whether the item is cursed."}
{"question": "What check might be needed to determine the value of a gemstone or art object?", "answer": "An Intelligence check, potentially using proficiency with Jeweler's Tools (for gems) or relevant Artisan's Tools or History skill (for art), could be used to appraise value."}
{"question": "If a spell scroll contains a spell not on your class's spell list, can you attempt to cast it?", "answer": "Yes, but you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect. If you succeed, the spell is cast."}
{"question": "Can you attempt to copy a spell from a spell scroll into your Wizard's spellbook?", "answer": "Yes. A spell on a spell scroll can be copied just like spells in other spellbooks, provided the spell is on the Wizard spell list and of a level you can prepare. This process consumes the scroll."}
{"question": "What happens if you cast *Dispel Magic* on a magical effect created by a higher-level spell slot than the one you used for *Dispel Magic*?", "answer": "You must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. If you succeed, the spell ends."}
{"question": "Can *Dispel Magic* end the effects of a cursed magic item?", "answer": "No. *Dispel Magic* generally only affects active spells. Removing the curse from a magic item typically requires the *Remove Curse* spell or similar magic."}
{"question": "What is required to use the *Counterspell* reaction?", "answer": "You must be able to see a creature within 60 feet of you casting a spell. You use your reaction to attempt to interrupt it."}
{"question": "How do you determine if *Counterspell* successfully interrupts a spell?", "answer": "If the spell being cast is of 3rd level or lower, it fails automatically. If it is 4th level or higher, you make an ability check using your spellcasting ability against a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level. On a success, the spell fails."}
{"question": "Can you use *Counterspell* if you cast it using a higher-level spell slot?", "answer": "Yes. If you cast *Counterspell* using a spell slot of a level equal to or higher than the level of the spell being cast, the spell automatically fails without requiring an ability check."}
{"question": "What does the 'Upcasting' section of a spell description signify?", "answer": "The 'At Higher Levels' or 'Upcasting' section describes additional or enhanced effects the spell gains when cast using a spell slot of a higher level than the spell's base level."}
{"question": "If a spell creates difficult terrain, does it affect flying creatures?", "answer": "Generally, no. Difficult terrain usually affects ground movement. A spell creating difficult terrain on the ground wouldn't hinder a creature flying above it, unless the spell specifically says otherwise (e.g., magically turbulent air)."}
{"question": "Can you take a Bonus Action during the same turn you use your Reaction?", "answer": "Yes. Bonus Actions and Reactions are separate types of actions with different triggers and limitations. Using one does not prevent using the other in the same round (though typically not on the exact same turn unless your reaction trigger occurs on your own turn after your bonus action)."}
{"question": "How does Flanking work (as an optional rule)?", "answer": "If using the optional Flanking rule (DMG Ch 8), when a creature and its ally are adjacent to an enemy and on opposite sides or corners of the enemy's space, they flank the enemy, and each gains Advantage on melee attack rolls against that enemy."}
{"question": "What happens if an effect imposes disadvantage on a saving throw where you normally have advantage (e.g., from *Ring of Evasion*)?", "answer": "The advantage and disadvantage cancel each other out, and you make the saving throw with a single d20."}
{"question": "Can you use a poisoner's kit to identify a poison?", "answer": "Yes. Proficiency with a poisoner's kit allows you to make an Intelligence check to identify a poison, potentially determining its type and effects."}
{"question": "What ability check is used when trying to calm down a spooked horse using Animal Handling?", "answer": "This typically requires a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check, with the DC set by the DM based on the situation and the animal's temperament."}
{"question": "Does the benefit of the *Guidance* cantrip stack with proficiency or Expertise?", "answer": "Yes. *Guidance* adds a d4 to one ability check of the target's choice before the spell ends. This bonus is added alongside proficiency or Expertise bonuses."}
{"question": "When making an Unarmed Strike, what ability score modifier is typically used for the attack and damage rolls?", "answer": "An Unarmed Strike uses your Strength modifier for both the attack and damage rolls. The damage is normally 1 + your Strength modifier bludgeoning damage."}
{"question": "Can features that improve weapon attacks, like the Fighting Style feature or Divine Smite, apply to Unarmed Strikes?", "answer": "Generally, no. Unarmed strikes are considered melee weapon attacks for rules purposes, but features that specify 'weapon' (like the Dueling style needing a weapon in one hand) or require a specific type of weapon usually don't apply unless the feature explicitly includes unarmed strikes (like some Monk features)."}
{"question": "What happens if you target a creature with an attack roll but cannot see them due to heavy obscurement (like fog or magical darkness)?", "answer": "If you cannot see your target, you have Disadvantage on the attack roll against them."}
{"question": "Can you target a location you cannot see with a spell like Fireball?", "answer": "Yes, if a spell's area of effect originates from a point you choose within range, you can typically target a point you cannot see (like behind a wall), but you must guess its location. However, you still need line of effect from the point of origin to any potential targets within the area."}
{"question": "What is the maximum falling damage a creature can take?", "answer": "A creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet fallen, to a maximum of 20d6 damage."}
{"question": "Does falling onto a soft surface reduce falling damage?", "answer": "The rules do not specify automatic reduction for soft surfaces. The DM might rule that an exceptionally soft surface (like deep snow or mud) could potentially mitigate some damage, perhaps granting resistance or reducing the dice rolled, but this is a discretionary ruling."}
{"question": "How is passive Investigation calculated, if used?", "answer": "Similar to passive Perception, passive Investigation would be 10 + all modifiers normally applied to an Intelligence (Investigation) check."}
{"question": "When is passive Insight typically used?", "answer": "A DM might use a character's passive Wisdom (Insight) score to determine if they notice subtle tells or inconsistencies in an NPC's behavior or speech without the player actively stating they are trying to read the NPC (using the Search action)." }
{"question": "Can you use the Medicine skill to determine how a creature died?", "answer": "Yes, the Search action allows making a Wisdom (Medicine) check. If successful, you might determine the cause of death if it left discernible marks or symptoms, subject to the DM's description and the DC set."}
{"question": "What is the rule for moving through the space of a Prone creature?", "answer": "A creature's space is difficult terrain if it contains a Prone creature, unless that creature is Tiny or an ally."}
{"question": "Does the Incapacitated condition prevent a creature from moving?", "answer": "Yes. An Incapacitated creature cannot take actions or reactions, and movement requires using speed, which is typically done as part of an action or move action that an Incapacitated creature cannot take."}
{"question": "If a creature is immune to the Charmed condition, can it still be affected by spells that charm, like Charm Person?", "answer": "No. Immunity to the Charmed condition means the creature cannot be Charmed at all, rendering spells or effects that apply the Charmed condition ineffective against it."}
{"question": "How long does it take to stabilize a creature using a Healer's Kit?", "answer": "Using a Healer's Kit to stabilize a creature takes one action (Utilize) and expends one use of the kit. It automatically stabilizes the creature without requiring a Wisdom (Medicine) check."}
{"question": "Can you use an action to administer a potion to an unconscious creature?", "answer": "Yes. Administering a potion to another creature requires an action (or potentially a bonus action for a Potion of Healing, depending on interpretation of 'drinking or administering')."}
{"question": "What are the rules for donning or doffing a shield?", "answer": "Donning (equipping) or doffing (removing) a shield requires taking the Utilize action."}
{"question": "If a spell has a range of 'Self', can it affect other creatures?", "answer": "Only if the spell description explicitly states it affects other creatures within a certain radius or under specific conditions (e.g., an aura). Otherwise, a spell with range 'Self' targets only the caster."}
{"question": "What happens if you cast a spell that requires concentration while already concentrating on another spell?", "answer": "Your concentration on the first spell ends immediately when you begin casting the second spell that also requires concentration."}
{"question": "Does difficult terrain affect flying speed?", "answer": "No, difficult terrain on the ground does not affect creatures that are flying over it."}
{"question": "Can you use the Ready action to prepare movement?", "answer": "No. The Ready action allows you to prepare one specific action (Attack, Cast a Spell, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, Hide, Search, Study, Utilize) or 'move up to your speed' to take in response to a trigger. You ready the *move itself*, not the *Dash* action specifically."}
{"question": "What is the typical cost and weight of 50 feet of hempen rope?", "answer": "50 feet of hempen rope typically costs 1 GP and weighs 10 pounds."}
{"question": "How much air does a typical humanoid consume from a waterskin or flask per hour while suffocating?", "answer": "This isn't explicitly defined. The suffocation rules focus on holding breath duration, not consumption rate from a container. A waterskin or flask wouldn't provide breathable air."}
{"question": "What is the light radius provided by a standard torch?", "answer": "A torch sheds Bright Light in a 20-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 20 feet."}
{"question": "Can you use oil from a flask to make a weapon deal fire damage?", "answer": "No, simply applying oil doesn't make a weapon deal fire damage. You can throw the oil flask at a target (action, Dex save), and if the target takes fire damage *while oiled* (within 1 minute), it takes an extra 5 fire damage once."}
{"question": "How does the Magic action interact with casting spells that have a casting time of 1 Action?", "answer": "Taking the Magic action allows you to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 Action."}
{"question": "Can you use the Study action to recall information about a creature's resistances or vulnerabilities?", "answer": "Yes, the Study action allows making an Intelligence check (potentially using Arcana, Nature, or Religion depending on the creature type) to recall lore about monsters, which might include common resistances, vulnerabilities, or traits."}
{"question": "If a creature has Damage Resistance to Bludgeoning damage, how much damage do they take from a 30-foot fall (normally 3d6)?", "answer": "They would take half of the rolled 3d6 bludgeoning damage, rounded down. Resistance applies unless the damage source specifies otherwise (e.g., 'nonmagical weapons')."}
{"question": "Can you apply poison to a weapon as a free object interaction?", "answer": "No. Applying poison typically requires a specific action or bonus action as defined by the poison's description (e.g., Bonus Action for Basic Poison)." }
{"question": "If a character has proficiency in both the Athletics skill and Smith's Tools, do they get Advantage on a Strength check to break down a metal door using the tools?", "answer": "Yes. According to the 2024 PHB rules, having proficiency with both the skill (Athletics) and the tool (Smith's Tools) used for the same check grants Advantage on that check, in addition to adding the Proficiency Bonus once."}
{"question": "What is required to qualify for the multiclassing prerequisites?", "answer": "You must have a score of at least 13 in the primary ability score(s) required by your current class(es) AND the primary ability score(s) required by the new class you wish to take a level in."}
{"question": "If you multiclass into Wizard, do you gain proficiency in Intelligence saving throws?", "answer": "No. When multiclassing, you only gain the specific proficiencies listed in the 'Multiclassing Proficiencies' section for the new class. Wizards grant Intelligence and Wisdom saving throw proficiency only at level 1."}
{"question": "Do features named 'Extra Attack' from different classes stack?", "answer": "No. If you gain the Extra Attack feature from multiple classes, they don't combine. You only benefit from the feature once, allowing one additional attack when you take the Attack action (unless a feature explicitly grants more, like the Fighter's higher-level versions)."}
{"question": "Under what specific conditions can a Rogue use their Sneak Attack feature?", "answer": "A Rogue can use Sneak Attack once per turn on an attack using a Finesse or Ranged weapon if they have Advantage on the attack roll, OR if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of the target, that enemy isn't Incapacitated, and the Rogue doesn't have Disadvantage on the attack roll."}
{"question": "Can a Barbarian maintain their Rage if they don't attack or take damage on their turn?", "answer": "No. A Barbarian's Rage ends early if they are knocked Unconscious or if their turn ends and they haven't attacked a hostile creature since their last turn or taken damage since then."}
{"question": "While using Wild Shape, does a Druid use their own physical ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution) or the beast's?", "answer": "While transformed by Wild Shape, the Druid uses the beast's Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores. They retain their own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores."}
{"question": "What happens to a Druid's equipment when they use Wild Shape?", "answer": "When the Druid transforms, they choose whether their equipment falls to the ground in their space, merges into their new form, or is worn by it (if the new form is physically capable of wearing it). Merged equipment has no effect until the Druid leaves the form."}
{"question": "What types of actions can a Cleric typically use their Channel Divinity for?", "answer": "Each Cleric domain grants specific uses for Channel Divinity, often including the Turn Undead feature. Other uses might involve dealing damage, healing, charming creatures, or other divine effects described in the domain's features."}
{"question": "Can a fighter with the Dueling fighting style add the +2 damage bonus when wielding a versatile weapon with two hands?", "answer": "No. The Dueling fighting style specifies the bonus applies only when wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons."}
{"question": "What determines the DC for a Monk's Ki features, like Stunning Strike?", "answer": "A Monk's Ki save DC is calculated as 8 + their Proficiency Bonus + their Wisdom modifier."}
{"question": "Can a Paladin use Divine Smite on a ranged weapon attack?", "answer": "No. The Divine Smite feature explicitly states it can be used when the Paladin hits a creature with a *melee* weapon attack."}
{"question": "Can a Warlock replace an Eldritch Invocation they know?", "answer": "Yes. When a Warlock gains a level in the Warlock class, they can choose one of the invocations they know and replace it with another invocation that they could learn at that level."}
{"question": "How does a Wizard add new spells to their spellbook?", "answer": "A Wizard adds two wizard spells of their choice (of levels they can cast) to their spellbook for free each time they gain a wizard level. They can also copy spells found in other spellbooks or on scrolls into their own spellbook, requiring time and gold cost based on the spell's level."}
{"question": "Can the *Counterspell* spell be used against a spell cast using the Subtle Spell Metamagic?", "answer": "No. *Counterspell* requires the caster to see a creature casting a spell. Since Subtle Spell removes the verbal and somatic components, there is typically nothing to perceive, making the spell impossible to counter unless it also has a visible material component."}
{"question": "If *Dispel Magic* is cast on a creature affected by multiple spells, how is the outcome determined?", "answer": "You choose one creature, object, or magical effect within range. Any spell of 3rd level or lower on the target ends. For each spell of 4th level or higher, you make an ability check (DC 10 + spell's level) using your spellcasting ability. On a success, that specific spell ends."}
{"question": "Does casting *Dispel Magic* on a magic item suppress its properties?", "answer": "*Dispel Magic* has no effect on magic items themselves, only on active spells. To temporarily suppress a magic item's properties, a spell like *Antimagic Field* is needed."}
{"question": "What happens when a summoned creature's Hit Points drop to 0?", "answer": "Unless the summoning spell specifies otherwise, a summoned creature reduced to 0 HP typically disappears, returning to its home plane or simply ceasing to exist. It does not usually make death saving throws."}
{"question": "Do summoned creatures act on their own initiative count?", "answer": "It depends on the spell. Many newer summoning spells (like *Summon Beast*, *Summon Fey*, etc.) state the creature acts immediately after your turn. Older spells like *Conjure Animals* often have the creatures roll their own initiative or act on the caster's turn, as determined by the DM."}
{"question": "Can you Overrun a hostile creature (DMG optional action)?", "answer": "Yes, using the optional Overrun action (DMG Ch 9), you can use your action or bonus action to make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics). If you win and are larger than the target, you can move through its space once this turn."}
{"question": "What is the Tumble action (DMG optional action)?", "answer": "As an action or bonus action (DMG Ch 9), you can try to tumble through a hostile creature's space by making a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by the target's Dexterity (Acrobatics). If successful, you can move through the hostile creature's space once this turn."}
{"question": "What are the rules for a mount acting independently in combat?", "answer": "An independent mount (one not being actively controlled) retains its own place in the initiative order and acts according to its nature, potentially fleeing danger, attacking perceived threats, or moving as it pleases. You still benefit from being mounted but don't direct its actions."}
{"question": "Can you attack an object like a door or a chest?", "answer": "Yes. Objects have Armor Class and Hit Points (DM determines these, with examples in DMG Ch 8). Attacks against objects often automatically hit if the object is stationary. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage but may have resistance or vulnerability to other types."}
{"question": "What happens if a character doesn't sleep for an extended period?", "answer": "Going without a Long Rest causes issues. After 24 hours without finishing a Long Rest, a creature must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of Exhaustion. The DC increases by 5 for each consecutive 24-hour period without a Long Rest."}
{"question": "How does Blindsight interact with invisibility?", "answer": "A creature with Blindsight can perceive its surroundings within a specific radius without relying on sight. It can effectively 'see' an invisible creature within that radius, negating the benefits of invisibility related to sight."}
{"question": "How does Tremorsense work?", "answer": "A creature with Tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the origin of vibrations within a specific radius, provided that the creature and the source of the vibrations are in contact with the same ground or substance. It doesn't rely on sight and can detect creatures that are invisible or obscured, as long as they are touching the ground."}
{"question": "What can Truesight perceive that normal vision cannot?", "answer": "Within its specified range, Truesight allows a creature to see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceive the original form of a shapechanger or a creature transformed by magic. It also allows seeing into the Ethereal Plane."}
{"question": "What is the 'Carousing' downtime activity (DMG Ch 6)?", "answer": "Carousing involves spending time (typically a week) socializing, feasting, and gambling in a settlement. It costs gold based on lifestyle but can result in making new contacts (friendly or hostile) determined by Persuasion/Intimidation checks and random rolls."}
{"question": "What does the 'Research' downtime activity entail (DMG Ch 6)?", "answer": "A character can spend time (at least one day) and gold (for materials/access) researching lore in a library or similar place. They make an Intelligence check (appropriate skill) with a DC based on the obscurity of the information sought. Success yields the information; failure means more time/cost is needed."}
{"question": "What are the effects of the sixth level of Exhaustion?", "answer": "A creature suffering the sixth level of Exhaustion dies."}
{"question": "If a creature is both Poisoned (disadvantage on attacks/checks) and Frightened (disadvantage on attacks/checks), do they roll with double disadvantage?", "answer": "No. If multiple circumstances impose disadvantage on a roll, you still only roll two d20s and use the lower result. Disadvantage does not stack."}
{"question": "Can you use Cartographer's Tools to determine your precise location?", "answer": "Not directly. Cartographer's Tools are used for creating maps. While making a map helps understand an area, determining precise location often involves Navigator's Tools (for triangulation/celestial navigation) or Wisdom (Survival) checks."}
{"question": "What check might be used with Cobbler's Tools to create hidden compartments in shoes?", "answer": "This would likely require a Dexterity check using proficiency with Cobbler's Tools, potentially contested by an Intelligence (Investigation) check to find the compartment later. The DM would set the DC based on complexity."}
{"question": "Can Glassblower's Tools be used to create lenses for a Spyglass or Magnifying Glass?", "answer": "Yes, proficiency with Glassblower's Tools allows crafting glass items, including lenses, though creating items with specific magical or precise optical properties might require additional checks or resources (like formulas or higher DCs)." }
{"question": "How do charges typically recharge for magic items like wands or staffs?", "answer": "Most items with charges regain a certain number of expended charges daily at dawn (e.g., 1d6 + 4 charges). If the last charge is expended, there's often a chance (like rolling a d20, item destroyed on a 1) the item is destroyed."}
{"question": "What does it mean if a magic item requires Attunement 'by a spellcaster'?", "answer": "The creature must have the ability to cast at least one spell using its own class features or racial traits to attune to the item. Being able to cast spells only from other magic items does not qualify."}
{"question": "What happens if you are targeted by an effect that would instantly kill you (not just reduce HP to 0), like the *Power Word Kill* spell?", "answer": "If you meet the conditions specified by the effect (e.g., having fewer than 101 HP for *Power Word Kill*), you die instantly without dropping to 0 HP or making death saving throws."}
{"question": "If a creature is stabilized at 0 HP, can it regain consciousness?", "answer": "No. A stabilized creature remains Unconscious until it regains at least 1 hit point (either through healing or after 1d4 hours automatically)." }
{"question": "Can the effects of the *Slow* spell stack with difficult terrain?", "answer": "Yes. The *Slow* spell halves a creature's speed and reduces its AC/Dex saves. Difficult terrain doubles the cost of movement. These effects combine, making movement extremely slow (e.g., moving 5 feet might cost 20 feet of speed: 10 ft base cost due to half speed, doubled to 20 ft for difficult terrain)."}
{"question": "What are the effects of the Blinded condition?", "answer": "A Blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight. Attack rolls against the creature have Advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have Disadvantage."}
{"question": "Does the Blinded condition prevent a creature from hearing or speaking?", "answer": "No, the Blinded condition only affects sight and checks/attacks related to sight. It does not affect hearing or speech directly."}
{"question": "What are the effects of the Charmed condition?", "answer": "A Charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects. The charmer has Advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature."}
{"question": "Can a creature Charmed by one person willingly attack that person's allies?", "answer": "Yes. The Charmed condition only prevents direct harm against the charmer, not necessarily their allies (unless the specific charm effect says otherwise)."}
{"question": "What are the effects of the Deafened condition?", "answer": "A Deafened creature can't hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing."}
{"question": "Does the Deafened condition prevent casting spells with verbal components?", "answer": "No. While the creature cannot *hear*, the condition doesn't explicitly state it prevents *speaking*. A creature must typically be able to speak clearly to provide verbal components; whether deafness prevents this is usually up to DM interpretation, but the condition itself doesn't stop speech."}
{"question": "How many levels of Exhaustion are there, and what is the effect of level 1?", "answer": "There are six levels of Exhaustion. Level 1 causes Disadvantage on ability checks."}
{"question": "What is the effect of Exhaustion level 3?", "answer": "At Exhaustion level 3, a creature has Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws."}
{"question": "What happens when a creature reaches Exhaustion level 6?", "answer": "The creature dies."}
{"question": "How can Exhaustion levels be removed?", "answer": "Finishing a Long Rest reduces a creature's Exhaustion level by 1, provided they have ingested some food and drink. Some magical effects like *Greater Restoration* can also reduce Exhaustion."}
{"question": "What are the effects of the Frightened condition?", "answer": "A Frightened creature has Disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight. The creature also can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear."}
{"question": "If the source of fear is removed from line of sight, do the effects of the Frightened condition immediately end?", "answer": "Not necessarily. The Disadvantage on checks and attacks ends if the source is out of sight, but the creature still cannot willingly move closer to the source's *last known location* unless the condition itself ends (e.g., via a successful saving throw if allowed by the effect)."}
{"question": "What are the effects of the Grappled condition?", "answer": "A Grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed. The condition ends if the grappler becomes Incapacitated or if an effect removes the grappled creature from the grappler's reach."}
{"question": "Does the Grappled condition impose disadvantage on the grappled creature's attack rolls?", "answer": "No, the Grappled condition itself does not impose disadvantage on attack rolls. Its primary effect is reducing speed to 0."}
{"question": "What are the effects of the Incapacitated condition?", "answer": "An Incapacitated creature can't take actions or reactions."}
{"question": "Can an Incapacitated creature move?", "answer": "Generally, no. While the condition doesn't explicitly state speed becomes 0, movement typically requires using your speed via an action or move, which an Incapacitated creature cannot take."}
{"question": "What are the effects of the Invisible condition?", "answer": "An Invisible creature is impossible to see without magic or special senses. It is Heavily Obscured for hiding. Attack rolls against it have Disadvantage, and its own attack rolls have Advantage."}
{"question": "Does being Invisible automatically mean a creature is hidden?", "answer": "No. While invisibility makes hiding easier (as the creature is heavily obscured), the creature must still take the Hide action to become hidden. An invisible creature can still be detected by sound or other senses."}
{"question": "What are the effects of the Paralyzed condition?", "answer": "A Paralyzed creature is Incapacitated, can't move or speak, automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws, attack rolls against it have Advantage, and any attack hitting it is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet."}
{"question": "What are the effects of the Petrified condition?", "answer": "A Petrified creature is transformed into stone, is Incapacitated, unaware, and can't move/speak. Its weight increases x10. It automatically fails Str/Dex saves, attacks against it have Advantage, it has Resistance to all damage, and is immune to poison/disease."}
{"question": "How can the Petrified condition usually be ended?", "answer": "The condition typically ends only through magic capable of reversing it, such as the *Greater Restoration* spell or similar powerful effects."}
{"question": "What are the effects of the Poisoned condition?", "answer": "A Poisoned creature has Disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks."}
{"question": "Does the Poisoned condition cause damage over time?", "answer": "Not inherently. The Poisoned condition itself only imposes disadvantage. The source of the poison (like a specific venom or spell) might cause additional effects, including damage, separately from the condition."}
{"question": "What are the effects of the Prone condition?", "answer": "A Prone creature's only movement option is to crawl (unless it stands up). It has Disadvantage on attack rolls. Attack rolls against it have Advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet, otherwise (if attacker is farther) the attack roll has Disadvantage."}
{"question": "How much movement does it cost to stand up from being Prone?", "answer": "Standing up uses an amount of movement equal to half the creature's speed. It cannot stand up if it has 0 speed or not enough movement left."}
{"question": "What are the effects of the Restrained condition?", "answer": "A Restrained creature's speed becomes 0. Attack rolls against it have Advantage, while its own attack rolls have Disadvantage. It also has Disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws."}
{"question": "What is the difference between the Grappled and Restrained conditions?", "answer": "Grappled primarily reduces speed to 0. Restrained reduces speed to 0 *and* imposes Disadvantage on the creature's attacks and Dexterity saves, while granting Advantage on attacks *against* the creature."}
{"question": "What are the effects of the Stunned condition?", "answer": "A Stunned creature is Incapacitated, can't move, speaks falteringly, automatically fails Str/Dex saves, and attacks against it have Advantage."}
{"question": "What are the effects of the Unconscious condition?", "answer": "An Unconscious creature is Incapacitated, can't move or speak, is unaware of surroundings, drops held items, and falls prone. It automatically fails Str/Dex saves, attacks against it have Advantage, and attacks hitting it are critical hits if the attacker is within 5 feet."}
{"question": "If a creature has multiple conditions (e.g., Blinded and Frightened), do the penalties stack?", "answer": "The effects of different conditions coexist. If multiple conditions impose Disadvantage on the same roll (like attack rolls for Blinded and Frightened), you still only have Disadvantage once, not 'double disadvantage'."}
{"question": "Can a creature concentrate on a spell while Incapacitated?", "answer": "No. The Incapacitated condition prevents taking actions or reactions, which breaks concentration."}
{"question": "Can a creature concentrate on a spell while Stunned?", "answer": "No. The Stunned condition includes the Incapacitated condition, which breaks concentration."}
{"question": "Can a creature concentrate on a spell while Paralyzed?", "answer": "No. The Paralyzed condition includes the Incapacitated condition, which breaks concentration."}
{"question": "Can a creature concentrate on a spell while Petrified?", "answer": "No. The Petrified condition includes the Incapacitated condition, which breaks concentration."}
{"question": "Can a creature concentrate on a spell while Unconscious?", "answer": "No. The Unconscious condition includes the Incapacitated condition, which breaks concentration."}
{"question": "Does the Grappled condition break concentration?", "answer": "No. Being Grappled only reduces speed to 0 and doesn't prevent actions or reactions needed for concentration."}
{"question": "Does the Restrained condition break concentration?", "answer": "No. Being Restrained reduces speed to 0 and imposes disadvantage on attacks/Dex saves, but doesn't prevent actions or reactions needed for concentration."}

{"question": "What is the typical walking speed for most Medium and Small sized playable species?", "answer": "The base walking speed for most common playable species, whether Medium or Small (like Dwarves, Elves, Humans, Halflings, Gnomes), is typically 30 feet per round."}
{"question": "What benefit does Darkvision grant?", "answer": "A creature with Darkvision can see in dim light within a specified radius (usually 60 feet) as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. They can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray."}

{"question": "What is the Halfling Brave trait?", "answer": "The Brave trait grants Halflings Advantage on saving throws against being Frightened."}
{"question": "Do Humans typically gain any special species traits like Darkvision or damage resistances?", "answer": "Standard Humans in most core rulesets are versatile but do not inherently possess traits like Darkvision or specific damage resistances. They often gain a feat or broader skill benefits instead, depending on the exact rules variant used."}
{"question": "What ability score increases do Humans receive from their species in the 2024 rules?", "answer": "None directly from the species. Like all species in the 2024 rules, ability score increases for Humans are determined by their chosen Background."}
{"question": "How does the Dragonborn Breath Weapon work?", "answer": "As an action, a Dragonborn exhales destructive energy in a line or cone (determined by ancestry). Creatures in the area make a saving throw (type determined by ancestry, DC based on Constitution). It deals damage (scaling with level) on a failed save, half on success. Usable once per short or long rest."}
{"question": "What determines the damage type and saving throw for a Dragonborn's Breath Weapon?", "answer": "The Dragonborn's specific Draconic Ancestry (e.g., Red dragons grant Fire damage and a Dexterity save, Blue dragons grant Lightning damage and a Dexterity save) determines these factors."}

{"question": "If you multiclass into a class that grants proficiency in a saving throw you already have proficiency in, do you get to choose a different saving throw proficiency?", "answer": "No, saving throw proficiencies gained from multiclassing are fixed according to the class description and do not grant alternatives if you already have proficiency."}

{"question": "What type of saving throw typically uses Charisma?", "answer": "Charisma saving throws are relatively rare but are used to resist effects that attempt to displace your soul, possess your body, banish you to another plane, or directly assault your sense of self."}
{"question": "Which ability modifier is added to the damage roll of a melee weapon attack?", "answer": "Typically, the Strength modifier is added to the damage roll of a melee weapon attack, unless the weapon has the Finesse property, in which case the attacker can choose to use their Dexterity modifier instead."}
{"question": "Which ability modifier determines a character's base Armor Class when not wearing armor?", "answer": "A character's Dexterity modifier is added to 10 to determine their base Armor Class when unarmored (unless they have a feature like Unarmored Defense that uses a different calculation)."}

{"question": "Which ability score determines the spell save DC and spell attack modifier for Bards, Paladins, Sorcerers, and Warlocks?", "answer": "Charisma is the spellcasting ability used to determine the spell save DC and spell attack modifier for Bards, Paladins, Sorcerers, and Warlocks."}
{"question": "If a feature allows you to add your ability modifier to a damage roll (e.g., Rage damage), do you still add your Strength/Dexterity modifier from the weapon attack itself?", "answer": "Yes, unless the feature specifically says it replaces the standard modifier. Bonuses from features like Rage damage are typically added *in addition* to the ability modifier normally added to the weapon's damage."}
{"question": "Does a high Constitution score grant resistance to any damage types?", "answer": "No. While Constitution represents health and resilience, and contributes to Hit Points and Constitution saving throws (often used against poison/disease), it does not inherently grant resistance to any specific damage type."}
{"question": "Can any character wear any type of armor?", "answer": "No. A character must have proficiency in the specific category of armor (Light, Medium, or Heavy) to wear it effectively without penalties."}

{"question": "Does wielding a shield without proficiency impose any penalties besides losing the AC bonus?", "answer": "No. Unlike armor, wielding a shield without proficiency simply means you don't get the +2 AC bonus; it doesn't impose disadvantage or prevent spellcasting."}
{"question": "Are there any prerequisites besides proficiency for wearing certain types of Heavy Armor?", "answer": "Yes. Some Heavy Armors, like Chain Mail, Splint, and Plate, have a minimum Strength score requirement listed. If a character wears this armor without meeting the Strength prerequisite, their speed is reduced by 10 feet."}
{"question": "Does the speed reduction from wearing Heavy Armor without meeting the Strength prerequisite stack with other speed reductions?", "answer": "Yes. Effects that reduce speed typically stack unless they come from the same named source or feature."}
{"question": "Can any character wield any weapon?", "answer": "Yes, any character can pick up and attempt to use any weapon."}

Failing to meet the requirement imposes Disadvantage on attack rolls with that weapon."}
{"question": "Can Small creatures effectively wield Heavy weapons?", "answer": "Small creatures (like Halflings and Gnomes) generally have Disadvantage on attack rolls made with Heavy weapons, regardless of their Strength or Dexterity score, due to the weapon's size and unwieldiness for them."}

{"question": "Can a character proficient with Martial Weapons use a Simple Weapon effectively?", "answer": "Yes. Proficiency with Martial Weapons implies proficiency with all Simple Weapons as well."}
{"question": "Can a character proficient only with Simple Weapons use a Martial Weapon effectively?", "answer": "No. They can wield it, but they attack without adding their Proficiency Bonus because they lack proficiency with Martial Weapons."}
{"question": "What is required to use an item as a Spellcasting Focus (like a Holy Symbol, Arcane Focus, or Druidic Focus)?", "answer": "A character must have a class feature that grants them the ability to use that specific type of item as a spellcasting focus (e.g., Clerics/Paladins for Holy Symbols, Wizards/Sorcerers/Warlocks for Arcane Foci, Druids/Rangers for Druidic Foci)."}
{"question": "Can a Wizard use a Holy Symbol as their spellcasting focus?", "answer": "No. A Wizard's Spellcasting feature specifies they use an Arcane Focus. They cannot substitute a Holy Symbol unless they gain the ability through another feature (like multiclassing or a feat)."}
{"question": "What is needed to use Thieves' Tools effectively?", "answer": "To add your Proficiency Bonus to checks made with Thieves' Tools (typically Dexterity checks for picking locks or disarming traps), you must have proficiency with Thieves' Tools, usually gained from a background (like Criminal) or class (like Rogue)."}
{"question": "Can you attempt to pick a lock without proficiency in Thieves' Tools?", "answer": "Yes, the DM might allow an attempt using improvised methods or just a raw Dexterity check, likely with Disadvantage or a higher DC, but you cannot add your Proficiency Bonus."}
{"question": "What proficiency is needed to effectively use an Herbalism Kit to craft potions or identify plants?", "answer": "Proficiency with the Herbalism Kit is required to add your Proficiency Bonus to ability checks (usually Intelligence or Wisdom) made using the kit for tasks like identifying plants or brewing potions like a Potion of Healing."}
{"question": "Does wearing Padded Armor or Hide Armor impose disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks?", "answer": "Padded Armor imposes disadvantage on Stealth checks. Hide Armor does *not* impose disadvantage on Stealth checks."}

{"question": "Can a character use a shield while wearing Heavy Armor?", "answer": "Yes, provided they have proficiency with both Heavy Armor and shields. The AC bonuses from both stack."}
{"question": "Can a character benefit from the Dexterity modifier bonus to AC while wearing Heavy Armor?", "answer": "No. Heavy Armor types (Ring Mail, Chain Mail, Splint, Plate) set a fixed base AC and do not allow adding the Dexterity modifier."}
{"question": "What is the maximum Dexterity modifier bonus that can be applied to AC when wearing Medium Armor?", "answer": "When wearing Medium Armor, you can add your Dexterity modifier, up to a maximum of +2, to your base AC provided by the armor."}

{"question": "What happens if you make an attack with a weapon you lack proficiency with?", "answer": "You do not add your Proficiency Bonus to the attack roll, making it harder to hit the target."}
{"question": "What does the Ammunition property on a weapon like a bow or crossbow indicate?", "answer": "It means you need a piece of the specified ammunition (e.g., arrow, bolt) for each attack, and you must have ammunition available to make the attack. Drawing ammunition is usually part of the attack action."}
{"question": "Can you recover ammunition used after a battle?", "answer": "Yes. After a fight, you can typically spend one minute searching the battlefield to recover about half of the ammunition you expended."}

{"question": "What is the consequence of wielding a weapon with the Heavy property if you are a Small creature?", "answer": "Small creatures, like Halflings and Gnomes, have Disadvantage on attack rolls made with Heavy weapons."}
{"question": "What is the consequence of wielding a Heavy melee weapon if your Strength score is less than 13?", "answer": "You have Disadvantage on attack rolls made with that weapon."}
{"question": "What is required to attack with a weapon that has the Two-Handed property?", "answer": "You must use two hands to wield the weapon when making an attack with it."}
{"question": "What does the Light property enable, regarding two-weapon fighting?", "answer": "When you take the Attack action and attack with a Light melee weapon in one hand, you can use your Bonus Action to attack with a different Light melee weapon held in your other hand."}
{"question": "Do you add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus action attack made with Two-Weapon Fighting?", "answer": "No, you do not add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus action attack granted by the Light property, unless that modifier is negative."}
{"question": "What limitation does the Loading property impose on weapons like crossbows?", "answer": "Due to the time needed to load, you can only fire one piece of ammunition from a Loading weapon when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of features like Extra Attack."}
{"question": "How does the Range property work for ranged weapons (e.g., Range 80/320)?", "answer": "The first number is the normal range (attacks are normal). The second number is the long range. Attacks against targets beyond normal range but within long range have Disadvantage. You cannot attack targets beyond the long range."}
{"question": "What does the Reach property on a weapon like a glaive or halberd do?", "answer": "The Reach property increases your reach by 5 feet when you attack with that weapon, and also when determining if a creature provokes an Opportunity Attack from you by leaving your reach."}
{"question": "How does the Thrown property work?", "answer": "A weapon with the Thrown property can be thrown to make a ranged attack within its specified range. You use the same ability modifier for the ranged attack and damage roll as you would for a melee attack with that weapon (Strength, unless it also has Finesse)." }

{"question": "What type of damage does the Graze weapon mastery property deal?", "answer": "When Graze triggers on a miss, it deals damage equal to the ability modifier used for the attack, and the damage type is the same as the weapon's normal damage type (e.g., slashing for a Greatsword)." }
{"question": "How does the Nick weapon mastery property modify Two-Weapon Fighting?", "answer": "Nick allows the bonus action attack normally granted by the Light property (when dual-wielding light weapons) to be made as part of the Attack action instead, freeing up the bonus action (usable once per turn)."}
{"question": "What saving throw does the Topple weapon mastery property force on a hit?", "answer": "It forces the target to make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + attack ability mod + proficiency bonus) or be knocked prone."}
{"question": "What size creatures can be affected by the Push weapon mastery property?", "answer": "The Push property can push a creature that is Large or smaller up to 10 feet away on a hit."}

{"question": "Can you use the Vex property if you hit but deal 0 damage?", "answer": "No. The Vex property specifies 'If you hit a creature with this weapon *and deal damage* to the creature...' before granting advantage."}
{"question": "Do Improvised Weapons typically allow you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll?", "answer": "Generally, no. If you use an object not designed as a weapon, you lack proficiency with it and do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll, unless the object resembles a weapon you *are* proficient with (DM's discretion)." }
{"question": "What damage die does an Improvised Weapon typically use?", "answer": "An object that resembles a weapon (like a table leg as a club) uses the damage die of the weapon it resembles (typically 1d4). An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage. The DM determines the damage type."}
{"question": "Can you make a ranged attack with a melee weapon that lacks the Thrown property?", "answer": "Yes, you can throw such a weapon, but it counts as an Improvised Weapon. It has a normal range of 20 feet, a long range of 60 feet, deals 1d4 damage (type appropriate to the weapon), and you don't add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll."}
{"question": "What does Alignment represent in D&D 5e?", "answer": "Alignment is a roleplaying tool that broadly describes a creature's moral outlook (Good, Evil, or Neutral) and ethical stance towards society and order (Lawful, Chaotic, or Neutral)."}
{"question": "Does a creature's alignment force them to act in a certain way?", "answer": "No. Alignment describes a creature's typical attitudes and beliefs, but it doesn't restrict their actions. Creatures can act against their alignment, and consistent actions might lead to a change in alignment."}
{"question": "Can characters of different alignments (e.g., Good and Evil) work together in the same party?", "answer": "Yes, characters with different alignments can cooperate, especially if they share common goals. However, their differing methods and morals might lead to in-party conflict, which requires mature roleplaying from the group."}
{"question": "What does it mean for a creature to be 'Unaligned'?", "answer": "Unaligned creatures typically lack the capacity for moral reasoning or complex ethical judgment. Most beasts and creatures acting purely on instinct are Unaligned. They are not considered Good or Evil."}

{"question": "What is the typical alignment of Fiends, like Devils and Demons?", "answer": "Fiends, native to the Lower Planes, are typically of Evil alignment. Devils are usually Lawful Evil, while Demons are usually Chaotic Evil."}
{"question": "Can alignment affect how a character experiences certain planes of existence?", "answer": "Yes. The Outer Planes embody specific alignments. A creature whose alignment strongly conflicts with a plane's essence (e.g., a Good creature in the Abyss, an Evil creature on Mount Celestia) may feel dissonance or discomfort, potentially suffering penalties on extended stays (DM's discretion or specific planar rules)."}
{"question": "Does a character's chosen deity need to match their alignment?", "answer": "No. A character can worship any deity regardless of their own alignment or the deity's presumed alignment. Worship doesn't require strict adherence to the deity's tenets."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of choosing a Background during character creation?", "answer": "A character's Background represents their life experiences, occupation, and place in the world before becoming an adventurer. It provides starting proficiencies (skills, tools), starting equipment or gold, ability score increases (in 2024 rules), a feat, and roleplaying suggestions (like bonds, flaws, ideals)."}
{"question": "Where do a character's initial skill and tool proficiencies primarily come from?", "answer": "Initial skill and tool proficiencies are granted by the character's chosen Background and Class."}
{"question": "How are ability score increases determined by Backgrounds in the 2024 PHB rules?", "answer": "Each Background lists three associated ability scores. The player can choose to increase one of those scores by 2 and a different one by 1, OR increase all three listed scores by 1. No score can be increased above 20 this way."}
{"question": "Does every Background grant a feat?", "answer": "Yes, according to the 2024 Player's Handbook rules, each Background grants a specific Origin Feat (listed in Chapter 5)."}
{"question": "Can a player customize their character's Background?", "answer": "Yes. The descriptions are suggestions. Players are encouraged to work with the DM to tweak features, proficiencies, or narrative details of a background to better fit their character concept, potentially swapping proficiencies or equipment of similar type or value."}
{"question": "What are Personality Traits, Ideals, Bonds, and Flaws provided by a Background used for?", "answer": "These are roleplaying suggestions designed to help players flesh out their character's personality, motivations, connections, and weaknesses. They provide hooks for roleplaying and character development but are not strict rules."}
{"question": "If a character gains the same skill proficiency from two different sources (e.g., class and background), what happens?", "answer": "If you would gain the same proficiency from multiple sources, you can choose a different proficiency of the same kind (skill or tool) instead."}
{"question": "What is Heroic Inspiration?", "answer": "Heroic Inspiration is a resource a player can expend to reroll one d20 roll (attack roll, ability check, or saving throw) immediately after rolling it. The player must use the result of the second roll."}
{"question": "How does a player typically gain Heroic Inspiration?", "answer": "The Dungeon Master can award Heroic Inspiration to a player when their character performs a particularly heroic, clever, entertaining, or in-character action that enhances the game for everyone. Some features (like the Human species trait) might also grant it automatically."}
{"question": "Can a character have more than one instance of Heroic Inspiration at a time?", "answer": "No. A character can only hold one instance of Heroic Inspiration. If they would gain another while already having one, they can choose to give the new instance to another player character in the group who doesn't have one."}
{"question": "If you have Advantage or Disadvantage on a roll, and use Heroic Inspiration to reroll, how many dice do you reroll?", "answer": "When you have Advantage or Disadvantage (rolling two d20s), using Heroic Inspiration allows you to reroll only *one* of those two d20s. You choose which one to reroll."}
{"question": "Is Heroic Inspiration the same as Bardic Inspiration?", "answer": "No. Heroic Inspiration is a general mechanic awarded by the DM or certain features allowing a reroll. Bardic Inspiration is a specific Bard class feature granting an extra die (d6, d8, etc.) that an ally can *add* to a roll."}
{"question": "Does the Acolyte background typically grant proficiency related to religion?", "answer": "Yes, the Acolyte background typically grants proficiency in the Insight and Religion skills."}

{"question": "What tool proficiency does the Sailor background grant?", "answer": "The Sailor background grants proficiency with Navigator's Tools and vehicles (water)."}
{"question": "Does the Soldier background grant proficiency with any weapons or armor?", "answer": "No. While themed around military life, Backgrounds in the 2024 rules typically grant skill and tool proficiencies, not armor or weapon proficiencies (those come mainly from Class)."}
{"question": "What skills are typically granted by the Sage background?", "answer": "The Sage background typically grants proficiency in the Arcana and History skills."}
{"question": "What is the primary role of magic items in a D&D 5e campaign?", "answer": "Magic items serve as rewards that grant characters new capabilities, enhance existing ones, or provide utility, adding wonder and power beyond standard class features. They are generally considered bonuses, not necessities for baseline character effectiveness."}
{"question": "Are magic items required for characters to face campaign threats effectively?", "answer": "No, D&D 5e character and monster math is generally balanced assuming minimal or no magic items. Magic items make characters more powerful or versatile, but are not strictly necessary to overcome standard challenges appropriate for their level."}
{"question": "What does a magic item's 'Rarity' (Common, Uncommon, Rare, Very Rare, Legendary, Artifact) generally indicate?", "answer": "Rarity provides a rough measure of a magic item's power, prevalence, and general level appropriateness. Common items are weakest/most frequent, while Legendary/Artifact items are exceptionally powerful and rare."}
{"question": "What resource provides guidelines for the number and rarity of magic items a party might typically acquire over a campaign?", "answer": "The Dungeon Master's Guide (DMG Chapter 7 in 2014, likely similar in 2024) provides tables like 'Magic Items Awarded by Level' suggesting typical distribution across character level tiers."}
{"question": "According to typical DMG guidelines, roughly how many magic items might a party find between levels 1 and 4?", "answer": "Guidelines suggest around 11 items total in the first tier (levels 1-4), primarily Common and Uncommon, with perhaps one Rare item towards the end."}
{"question": "When placing magic items in an adventure, should the DM assume the party will find every item?", "answer": "No. It's recommended to place slightly more items (perhaps 25% more than the guideline suggests for the level range) than expected, assuming the party might miss some through exploration or choices."}
{"question": "When creating a new magic item, what table can guide the appropriate power level based on rarity?", "answer": "The DMG provides a 'Magic Item Power by Rarity' table (or similar), suggesting maximum spell levels for item effects and appropriate static bonuses (+1, +2, etc.) based on the intended rarity."}
{"question": "What is the suggested maximum spell level effect for an Uncommon magic item property (e.g., usable once per day)?", "answer": "An Uncommon item typically shouldn't replicate a spell effect higher than 3rd level for a limited-use property."}
{"question": "What is the suggested maximum static bonus (to AC, attack rolls, saves) for a Rare magic item?", "answer": "A Rare magic item typically grants a maximum bonus of +2."}
{"question": "What is the suggested maximum static bonus (to AC, attack rolls, saves) for a Legendary magic item?", "answer": "A Legendary magic item typically grants a maximum bonus of +3 (or sometimes +4 for Artifacts, though Artifacts often have unique, non-numerical effects). Note: The 2024 DMG changes this slightly, capping Legendary at +4."}
{"question": "When should a DM consider requiring Attunement for a magic item they create?", "answer": "Attunement is recommended if an item provides a significant persistent benefit (like a bonus to AC or saves), if sharing the item rapidly among the party would be disruptive or overly powerful, or if the item grants bonuses that could stack undesirably with other items."}
{"question": "What is the maximum number of magic items a character can normally be Attuned to?", "answer": "A character can be attuned to a maximum of three magic items at one time."}
{"question": "Can a DM modify existing magic items from the rulebooks?", "answer": "Yes, DMs are encouraged to modify items. This can involve changing the item's form (e.g., ring to amulet), altering damage types, replacing one capability with a similar one, or adding minor properties/quirks/history."}
{"question": "What are 'Minor Properties' and 'Quirks' for magic items?", "answer": "These are optional flavorful details (often determined randomly using DMG tables) that can make a magic item unique without significantly altering its power level. Examples include glowing faintly near certain creatures, having a specific origin, or causing the user to feel unnaturally confident."}
{"question": "How durable are magic items compared to nonmagical ones?", "answer": "Magic items are generally more durable than their nonmagical counterparts. Most magic items (except consumables like potions/scrolls) have Resistance to all damage. Artifacts are typically indestructible except by specific, unique means."}
{"question": "What is an Artifact in D&D terms?", "answer": "An Artifact is a unique, exceptionally powerful magic item, often tied to major historical events or figures. They serve as significant plot devices and are rarely found or kept permanently by player characters."}
{"question": "How are Artifacts typically introduced into a campaign?", "answer": "Artifacts usually appear only when the DM intends them to, often as the central goal of a high-level quest (to find, destroy, or prevent a villain from using it), rather than as random treasure."}
{"question": "Can Artifacts have negative properties?", "answer": "Yes, Artifacts often possess detrimental properties (minor or major) in addition to their powerful beneficial ones, reflecting their immense power or troubled history. These can range from personality changes to attracting powerful enemies."}
{"question": "What is required for a character to craft a magic item (beyond SRD Potion/Scroll rules)?", "answer": "Crafting magic items typically requires proficiency in Arcana, proficiency with relevant tools, access to specific formulas or recipes, expensive raw materials (often exotic or rare), and significant downtime, as detailed in DMG or Xanathar's Guide optional rules."}
{"question": "Should a DM carefully consider the impact before giving out items that grant flight at low levels?", "answer": "Yes, granting flight (e.g., via Winged Boots or a Broom of Flying) significantly alters how characters can overcome exploration and combat challenges. DMs should consider if they are prepared for this impact early in a campaign."}
{"question": "How can a DM handle a party acquiring too many powerful magic items for their level?", "answer": "The DM can adjust future encounters to account for the party's increased power, provide fewer magic items in subsequent adventures, introduce challenges that target saving throws or skills rather than AC/attack rolls, or create narrative reasons for items to be temporarily lost or expended."}
{"question": "What is a simple way to create a new Common magic item?", "answer": "Common items typically provide minor utility or flavor. A simple approach is to grant the ability to cast a cantrip once or twice per day, or replicate a minor, non-combat effect from a 1st-level spell with limited uses."}
{"question": "Can magic items be bought and sold in most D&D settings?", "answer": "This varies greatly by setting and DM preference. Some settings have established markets (like Greyhawk or Sigil), while others treat magic items as rare discoveries not typically for sale. The DMG provides optional rules and value estimates based on rarity if buying/selling is allowed."}
{"question": "What is the approximate market value suggested for a Rare magic item, if buying/selling is allowed?", "answer": "DMG guidelines typically place the base value of a Rare non-consumable item around 4,000 GP to 5,000 GP, subject to availability and negotiation."}
{"question": "What is the approximate market value suggested for an Uncommon magic item, if buying/selling is allowed?", "answer": "DMG guidelines typically place the base value of an Uncommon non-consumable item around 400 GP to 500 GP."}
{"question": "Should consumable items like potions and scrolls cost less than permanent items of the same rarity?", "answer": "Yes, guidelines typically suggest halving the base market value for consumable items (other than spell scrolls, which have specific crafting/value rules)." }
{"question": "What are the three types of components a spell might require?", "answer": "Spells can require Verbal (V - spoken incantation), Somatic (S - hand gestures), and/or Material (M - physical objects or substances) components."}
{"question": "Can a spell be cast if the caster cannot provide one of its required components?", "answer": "No. A spellcaster must be able to provide all of a spell's required components (V, S, M) to successfully cast the spell."}
{"question": "What prevents a caster from providing Verbal (V) components?", "answer": "Being gagged, unable to speak, or being within an area of magical silence (like the *Silence* spell) prevents the use of Verbal components."}
{"question": "What is required to provide Somatic (S) components?", "answer": "The caster must have at least one hand free to perform the necessary gestures. This hand can be the same one holding a material component or spellcasting focus."}
{"question": "Can a spellcasting focus or component pouch replace *any* Material (M) component?", "answer": "No. They can only replace Material components that do *not* have a specific cost listed in the spell description and are *not* consumed by the spell."}
{"question": "If a Material (M) component has a specific gold piece cost, must the caster provide that specific item?", "answer": "Yes. Material components with a listed cost must be provided explicitly; a focus or component pouch cannot substitute for them."}
{"question": "Are Material (M) components consumed when casting a spell?", "answer": "Material components are only consumed if the spell's description explicitly states that they are. Otherwise, the same component can be used repeatedly."}
{"question": "What is the standard casting time for most combat spells?", "answer": "Most spells designed for use in combat have a casting time of 1 Action."}
{"question": "What is the rule for casting spells when one spell has a casting time of 1 Bonus Action?", "answer": "If you cast any spell using a Bonus Action on your turn, the only other spells you can cast on that same turn are cantrips with a casting time of 1 Action."}
{"question": "Can you cast two different cantrips on the same turn using an Action and a Bonus Action?", "answer": "Only if one of the cantrips specifically has a casting time of 1 Bonus Action (which is rare) and the other has a casting time of 1 Action. You cannot cast two Action-casting time cantrips."}
{"question": "How does casting a spell with a casting time of 1 Reaction work?", "answer": "A spell with a casting time of 1 Reaction is cast instantaneously in response to a specific trigger defined in the spell's description (e.g., *Shield* when hit by an attack, *Counterspell* when seeing a spell cast). It uses your reaction for the round."}
{"question": "What is required when casting a spell with a casting time longer than 1 action (e.g., 1 minute)?", "answer": "The caster must use their action each turn for the entire duration of the casting time and maintain Concentration on the spell during this period. If concentration is broken, the spell fails, and the spell slot is lost."}
{"question": "Does casting a spell with a range of 'Self' mean it only affects the caster?", "answer": "Not always. While the spell originates from the caster, 'Self' range often indicates an area of effect centered on or emanating from the caster (e.g., 'Self (15-foot cube)' or 'Self (30-foot radius)'). Check the spell description for details."}
{"question": "What is required to target a creature or point with a spell?", "answer": "You must typically have a clear path to the target, meaning it cannot be behind total cover (line of effect). For spells targeting something you can see, you also need line of sight."}
{"question": "How does an area of effect like a Sphere determine which creatures are affected?", "answer": "You select a point of origin for the sphere. The sphere extends outwards from that point. A creature is affected if its space overlaps with the sphere's area at all (typically, if at least half its space is within the area, though exact adjudication can vary)."}
{"question": "Where is the point of origin for a Cube area of effect?", "answer": "You select a point of origin, which lies on one face of the cubic effect. The cube extends from that face away from the caster."}
{"question": "How does an Emanation area of effect work?", "answer": "An emanation (like an Aura) originates from the caster or a specified point and moves with that origin, extending outwards in a radius. It typically affects creatures that enter or start their turn within the area."}
{"question": "What does a spell duration of 'Instantaneous' mean?", "answer": "The spell's magical effect happens and resolves immediately during the casting. It doesn't have an ongoing duration, although its consequences might be long-lasting (e.g., damage dealt, an object created)." }
{"question": "If a spell requires Concentration, what can cause the caster to lose concentration?", "answer": "Concentration can be broken by: 1) Casting another spell that requires concentration. 2) Taking damage (requires a Constitution save DC 10 or half damage taken, whichever is higher). 3) Being Incapacitated or killed. 4) Environmental factors or specific effects disrupting focus (DM's discretion)."}
{"question": "Is there a limit to how many spells a caster can concentrate on simultaneously?", "answer": "Yes, a creature can only concentrate on one spell at a time. Starting concentration on a new spell instantly ends concentration on any previous spell."}
{"question": "Can a spellcaster choose to end concentration on their spell early?", "answer": "Yes, a spellcaster can choose to end their concentration at any time, requiring no action."}
{"question": "What does 'Upcasting' a spell mean?", "answer": "Upcasting means casting a spell using a spell slot of a higher level than the spell's base level. Some spells gain enhanced effects (like more damage dice, more targets, or longer duration) when upcast, as detailed in their 'At Higher Levels' section."}
{"question": "If a spell allows a saving throw for half damage, what happens on a successful save?", "answer": "The creature takes half the damage that would normally be rolled for the spell (rounded down)." }
{"question": "How is the spell attack modifier calculated?", "answer": "Your spell attack modifier is equal to your spellcasting ability modifier + your Proficiency Bonus."}
{"question": "How are spell slots regained?", "answer": "Most spellcasting classes regain all expended spell slots after finishing a Long Rest. Warlocks regain their Pact Magic slots after a Short or Long Rest. Some features like Arcane Recovery allow limited slot recovery during a Short Rest."}
{"question": "What is a Ritual spell?", "answer": "A spell with the Ritual tag can be cast either normally using a spell slot and its standard casting time, OR as a ritual. Casting as a ritual adds 10 minutes to the casting time but does not expend a spell slot."}
{"question": "Who can cast spells as Rituals?", "answer": "A character must have a feature that specifically grants them the ability to cast spells as rituals (like Clerics, Druids, Wizards, or via the Ritual Caster feat). The spell must also have the Ritual tag and be prepared or known (or in the spellbook for Wizards)."}
{"question": "If two different buff spells affect the same statistic (e.g., both grant Advantage on Strength checks), do the effects stack?", "answer": "No. If multiple effects grant Advantage or Disadvantage on the same roll, they don't stack; you only get Advantage or Disadvantage once. If one effect grants Advantage and another imposes Disadvantage, they cancel out."}
{"question": "If a creature is affected by both *Slow* (halving speed) and *Haste* (doubling speed), what is their speed?", "answer": "The effects are applied based on game rules for combining effects. Multiplicative effects are usually applied before additive ones. Typically, effects like *Slow* and *Haste* would cancel each other out regarding speed modification, but specific spell interactions can be complex. Consult the rules on Combining Game Effects (DMG Ch 8 / updated core rules)."}
{"question": "Can you use an Intelligence (Arcana) check to determine the exact level of a spell being cast by someone else?", "answer": "Yes. When using your reaction to identify a spell being cast (DC 15 + spell level), a successful Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals the spell's identity and potentially its level."}
{"question": "What is required to copy a spell into a Wizard's spellbook?", "answer": "The Wizard needs the spell scroll or another spellbook containing the spell, time (2 hours per spell level), and gold cost (50 GP per spell level) for materials. The spell must be on the Wizard spell list and of a level they can prepare."}
{"question": "Does copying a spell into a Wizard's spellbook consume the original source (like a scroll)?", "answer": "Yes, if copying from a spell scroll, the scroll is consumed in the process. If copying from another Wizard's spellbook, the original remains intact."}
{"question": "Can a Sorcerer cast spells as rituals?", "answer": "Not typically. The Sorcerer class does not inherently grant the Ritual Casting feature. They would need to gain it through other means, such as the Ritual Caster feat."}
{"question": "Can a Warlock cast spells as rituals?", "answer": "Only if they choose the Pact of the Tome feature at 3rd level and select the Eldritch Invocation 'Book of Ancient Secrets', which allows them to inscribe and cast certain ritual spells."}
{"question": "What is the fundamental difference between how Wizards learn spells compared to Clerics or Druids?", "answer": "Wizards learn spells primarily through study and transcribing them into their spellbook. Clerics and Druids inherently know their entire class spell list and prepare a selection each day through meditation or prayer."}
{"question": "How does a Wizard determine which spells they can cast on any given day?", "answer": "A Wizard must prepare a list of spells from their spellbook after finishing a Long Rest. They can prepare a number of spells equal to their Intelligence modifier + their Wizard level. They can only cast spells that are currently prepared (in addition to cantrips and ritual spells cast as rituals)."}
{"question": "How does a Cleric or Druid determine which spells they can cast on any given day?", "answer": "Clerics and Druids prepare a list of spells each day after finishing a Long Rest. They can choose any spells from their entire class spell list, up to a number equal to their Wisdom modifier + their class level. They can only cast spells that are currently prepared (in addition to cantrips and ritual spells cast as rituals)."}
{"question": "How do Bards, Sorcerers, Rangers, Paladins, and Warlocks learn new spells?", "answer": "These classes learn a limited number of specific spells as they gain levels, adding them permanently to their list of 'Spells Known'. They do not prepare spells daily from a larger list; they can always attempt to cast any spell they know, provided they have an appropriate spell slot."}
{"question": "Can Bards, Sorcerers, Rangers, Paladins, or Warlocks change the spells they know?", "answer": "Yes. When these classes gain a level, they can typically choose to replace one spell they know with another spell from their class's spell list, provided the new spell is of a level they can cast."}
{"question": "How many spells does a Sorcerer know?", "answer": "A Sorcerer knows a fixed number of spells determined by their Sorcerer level, as shown in the Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table. They also know a number of cantrips based on their level."}
{"question": "How many spells does a Bard know?", "answer": "A Bard knows a fixed number of spells determined by their Bard level, as shown in the Spells Known column of the Bard table. They also know cantrips based on their level."}
{"question": "What is the source of spell slots for Warlocks?", "answer": "Warlocks gain spell slots through their Pact Magic feature. These slots are fewer in number but are always of the highest level the Warlock can cast and recharge on a Short Rest."}
{"question": "Can a Warlock use their Pact Magic slots to cast spells gained from other sources (like racial spells or feats)?", "answer": "Generally, yes. Pact Magic slots can be used to cast any spell the Warlock knows or has prepared, provided the spell's level is less than or equal to the slot level."}
{"question": "How does a Paladin or Ranger determine their number of spell slots?", "answer": "Paladins and Rangers are 'half-casters'. They gain spell slots at a slower progression than full casters like Wizards or Clerics, starting at 2nd level, as shown in their respective class tables."}
{"question": "Do Paladins and Rangers prepare spells or know spells?", "answer": "Paladins prepare spells daily from the Paladin spell list, similar to Clerics (Number = Cha mod + half Paladin level). Rangers know a fixed number of spells from the Ranger list, similar to Sorcerers (Number determined by Ranger level table)."}
{"question": "What are 'Domain Spells' for a Cleric?", "answer": "Each Cleric Divine Domain grants additional spells at specific Cleric levels. These Domain Spells are always considered prepared and do not count against the number of spells the Cleric can prepare each day."}
{"question": "What are 'Circle Spells' for a Druid (specifically Circle of the Land)?", "answer": "Circle of the Land Druids gain access to additional Circle Spells based on the type of land chosen for their circle (Arctic, Forest, etc.). These spells are always considered prepared and don't count against the number of spells the Druid can prepare daily."}
{"question": "What are 'Oath Spells' for a Paladin?", "answer": "Each Paladin Sacred Oath grants additional spells at specific Paladin levels. These Oath Spells are always considered prepared and do not count against the number of spells the Paladin can prepare each day."}
{"question": "Can a Wizard cast a spell directly from another Wizard's spellbook?", "answer": "No. A Wizard can only cast spells they have prepared. They can, however, spend time and gold to *copy* a spell from another spellbook or scroll into their *own* spellbook, potentially allowing them to prepare it later."}
{"question": "What happens if a Wizard loses their spellbook?", "answer": "Losing a spellbook is catastrophic for a Wizard. They retain knowledge of their prepared spells for the day but cannot prepare new spells or change their prepared list until they replace the spellbook. They only know the cantrips they have learned."}
{"question": "How can a Wizard replace a lost spellbook?", "answer": "A Wizard can use a blank book and scribe the spells they currently have prepared into it (1 hour and 10 GP per spell level). They can also find or purchase other spellbooks/scrolls to copy spells from, following the normal copying rules."}
{"question": "Can you cast a spell as a ritual if you only know it (like a Sorcerer) but don't have it prepared or in a spellbook?", "answer": "No. To cast a spell as a ritual, you must have the Ritual Casting feature *and* have the spell prepared (for Clerics/Druids/Paladins who prepare) or inscribed in your ritual book (for Wizards or characters with the Ritual Caster feat). Classes that only 'know' spells generally cannot cast them as rituals unless they gain the capability elsewhere."}
{"question": "If a creature is immune to spells of a certain level or lower, does *Counterspell* still work against those spells?", "answer": "Yes. *Counterspell* targets the *casting* of the spell, not the spell's effect or target. Immunity to spells doesn't typically prevent *Counterspell* from causing the casting to fail."}
{"question": "Does an area of magical silence prevent spells with only Somatic or Material components from being cast?", "answer": "No. Magical silence only prevents the casting of spells with a Verbal component."}
{"question": "If a spell creates an ongoing effect (like *Wall of Fire*), does the caster need to maintain line of sight to the effect?", "answer": "Generally, no. Once cast, ongoing effects persist for their duration regardless of the caster's line of sight, unless the spell description specifically requires it or the caster needs to use an action to control or move the effect."}
{"question": "Can a spell attack score a critical hit?", "answer": "Yes. If the d20 roll for a spell attack is a natural 20, it's a critical hit, and you roll all damage dice associated with the spell attack twice."}
{"question": "If a spell grants resistance to a damage type, does it stack with resistance from another source (like race or armor)?", "answer": "No. Multiple instances of resistance to the same damage type do not stack; you only apply the resistance once (halving the damage)." }
{"question": "What is the difference between preparing a spell and knowing a spell?", "answer": "'Preparing' (Clerics, Druids, Paladins, Wizards) means selecting a subset of spells from a larger list each day. 'Knowing' (Bards, Rangers, Sorcerers, Warlocks) means having a fixed list of spells available to cast at any time using available slots."}
{"question": "Can a character cast a spell learned from a feat (like Magic Initiate) using their own class spell slots?", "answer": "Typically, no, unless the feat specifically says otherwise. Spells granted by feats usually have their own usage limits (e.g., once per long rest) and use a specific ability score defined by the feat, separate from class spell slots."}
{"question": "If a feature allows casting a spell 'without expending a spell slot,' does it still consume material components?", "answer": "Yes, unless the feature explicitly states it also ignores components. Casting without a slot only removes the slot requirement; other components (V, S, M) are still needed unless specified otherwise."}
{"question": "What are the ability score requirements for multiclassing?", "answer": "To qualify for a new class, you must meet the minimum ability score requirement for your current class(es) *and* the minimum score requirement for the new class you wish to enter. These minimums are typically 13 in the class's primary ability score(s)."}
{"question": "If a Fighter (Str 13) wants to multiclass into Wizard (Int primary), what scores must be 13 or higher?", "answer": "The character must have both Strength 13+ (for Fighter) and Intelligence 13+ (for Wizard) to multiclass between these two classes."}
{"question": "When multiclassing, is the XP required to gain the next level based on your level in one class or your total character level?", "answer": "The XP required to gain the next level is always based on your total character level across all classes, as shown on the Character Advancement table."}
{"question": "How are Hit Points determined when taking a level in a new class after level 1?", "answer": "You gain Hit Points equal to rolling the Hit Die specified for the new class plus your Constitution modifier. You do not gain the maximum Hit Points granted at level 1 for subsequent classes."}
{"question": "How are Hit Dice calculated for a multiclass character?", "answer": "You add together the Hit Dice granted by each level taken in all your classes. If the dice are of different types (e.g., d8 from Cleric, d10 from Fighter), you track them separately."}
{"question": "How is the Proficiency Bonus determined for a multiclass character?", "answer": "Your Proficiency Bonus is based solely on your total character level, not your level in any specific class. For example, a level 3 Fighter / level 2 Rogue is a 5th-level character and has a +3 Proficiency Bonus."}
{"question": "When multiclassing into a new class, do you gain all of its starting proficiencies?", "answer": "No. You only gain the specific proficiencies (armor, weapons, skills, tools) listed in the 'Multiclassing Proficiencies' section for that class in the Player's Handbook (Chapter 3), not the full set granted to a level 1 character of that class."}
{"question": "Do you gain additional saving throw proficiencies when multiclassing?", "answer": "Generally, no. Saving throw proficiencies are typically granted only by your starting class at level 1."}
{"question": "If a character has the Unarmored Defense feature from both Barbarian (AC = 10 + Dex + Con) and Monk (AC = 10 + Dex + Wis), how is their AC calculated?", "answer": "Features that provide different ways to calculate AC do not stack. The character must choose which Unarmored Defense calculation (Barbarian's or Monk's) to use."}
{"question": "If a character gains the Extra Attack feature from multiple classes (e.g., Fighter 5 / Paladin 5), can they make three attacks with the Attack action?", "answer": "No. The Extra Attack feature gained from different classes does not stack. The character can still only make one additional attack when taking the Attack action, for a total of two attacks (unless a specific class feature, like the Fighter's level 11 feature, explicitly grants more)."}
{"question": "How are spell slots determined for a character multiclassing between classes with the Spellcasting feature (e.g., Cleric and Wizard)?", "answer": "You determine your effective spellcaster level by adding together all your levels in full caster classes (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard), half your levels (rounded up) in half-casters (Paladin, Ranger), and one-third levels (rounded down) in third-casters (Eldritch Knight, Arcane Trickster). You use the spell slots listed for that total level on the Multiclass Spellcaster table."}
{"question": "If you are a multiclass spellcaster (e.g., Wizard 3 / Cleric 2), how do you determine which spells you can prepare?", "answer": "You determine the spells you can prepare separately for each class, as if you were only a member of that class. In this example, you'd prepare Wizard spells as a 3rd-level Wizard and Cleric spells as a 2nd-level Cleric."}
{"question": "When casting a spell as a multiclass spellcaster, which spellcasting ability do you use?", "answer": "You use the spellcasting ability associated with the class from which you prepared or learned the spell (e.g., Intelligence for Wizard spells, Wisdom for Cleric spells)."}
{"question": "Can spell slots gained from the Spellcasting feature be used to cast spells learned via the Warlock's Pact Magic feature?", "answer": "Yes. If you have both the Spellcasting and Pact Magic features, you can use spell slots from either feature to cast spells you know or have prepared from any of your classes."}
{"question": "How do the Warlock's Pact Magic slots interact with the Multiclass Spellcaster table?", "answer": "They don't combine for calculating total slots. You determine your Spellcasting slots using the multiclass rules for your non-Warlock levels, and you determine your Pact Magic slots separately based only on your Warlock level. However, you can use slots from either pool to cast spells from either class."}
{"question": "Do Warlock Pact Magic slots recharge on a short rest even if the character has levels in other spellcasting classes?", "answer": "Yes. The Pact Magic feature specifies that Warlock spell slots are regained upon finishing a short or long rest, regardless of other classes."}
{"question": "If a character has Channel Divinity uses from both Cleric and Paladin levels, how many uses do they have?", "answer": "The number of times you can use Channel Divinity is based on the features granted by each class separately. You regain all expended uses according to the rules for each class (typically after a short or long rest for both). You don't add the number of uses together; you track uses granted by Cleric levels separately from uses granted by Paladin levels, though some DMs might allow using either pool for either class's Channel Divinity options."}
{"question": "If a multiclass character has features that both use a Bonus Action (e.g., Cunning Action from Rogue, Shillelagh activation from Druid), can they use both on the same turn?", "answer": "No. A character can only take one Bonus Action per turn, regardless of how many different options they have available."}
{"question": "Do cantrips known from different classes stack?", "answer": "Yes. You learn the cantrips granted by each class individually. For example, a Cleric 1 / Wizard 1 knows the cantrips granted by both level 1 Cleric and level 1 Wizard."}
{"question": "When a cantrip's damage increases at higher levels (e.g., Fire Bolt), is this increase based on class level or total character level?", "answer": "Cantrip damage scaling is based on your total character level, not your level in the class that granted the cantrip."}
{"question": "If a character multiclasses, when do they gain Ability Score Improvements (ASIs) or feats?", "answer": "ASIs are granted based on levels gained in a specific class, as shown on that class's advancement table (typically at levels 4, 8, 12, 16, and 19 for most classes). They are not based on total character level."}
{"question": "Can a Barbarian 1 / Monk 1 use Dexterity for their unarmed strikes while raging?", "answer": "Yes. The Monk feature allows using Dexterity for unarmed strikes. Rage requires Strength for its bonus damage and advantage on checks/saves, but doesn't prevent using Dexterity for the base attack/damage roll if another feature allows it."}
{"question": "Can a character with the Defense fighting style (+1 AC in armor) also benefit from Unarmored Defense?", "answer": "No. Unarmored Defense only functions when not wearing armor. The Defense style requires wearing armor. You can only benefit from one AC calculation method at a time."}
{"question": "If a feature allows casting a spell 'without expending a spell slot' a certain number of times per day, does multiclassing affect the number of uses?", "answer": "Generally, no. Such features are tied to the class that grants them, and the number of uses is usually determined by the level in *that specific class* or a fixed number, not total character level."}
{"question": "What is a feat in Dungeons & Dragons 5e?", "answer": "A feat represents a special talent, training, or area of expertise that gives a character unique capabilities beyond those granted by their class, background, or species."}
{"question": "How does a character typically acquire feats?", "answer": "Characters gain feats primarily through their Background (which grants an Origin feat at level 1) and through the Ability Score Improvement class feature, which allows choosing a feat instead of increasing ability scores at certain levels (typically 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th)."}
{"question": "Can a feat be taken more than once?", "answer": "Generally, no. A feat can only be taken once unless its description explicitly includes a 'Repeatable' subsection stating otherwise (e.g., Elemental Adept, Skilled, Ability Score Improvement)."}
{"question": "What does it mean if a feat has a prerequisite?", "answer": "A prerequisite is a condition that must be met to take the feat. This might be a minimum ability score, proficiency with certain armor/weapons, the ability to cast spells, or having a specific class level or feature. You cannot take a feat if you don't meet its prerequisites."}
{"question": "What are the main categories of feats presented in the 2024 Player's Handbook?", "answer": "Feats are organized into four categories: Origin (gained from Background), General (available via Ability Score Improvement), Fighting Style (often gained via class features, can sometimes be taken as a General feat), and Epic Boon (typically gained at level 20 or via DM award)."}
{"question": "What is an Origin feat?", "answer": "An Origin feat is granted by a character's Background at level 1, reflecting their early life experiences or inherent talents. Examples include Alert, Crafter, Healer, Lucky, Magic Initiate, Musician, Savage Attacker, Skilled, Tavern Brawler, and Tough."}
{"question": "What does the Ability Score Improvement feat allow?", "answer": "When gained via a class feature, this feat allows you to increase one ability score by 2, or increase two ability scores by 1 each. The score(s) cannot be increased above 20 using this feat."}
{"question": "Can you take the Ability Score Improvement feat multiple times?", "answer": "Yes. Each time your class grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can choose this feat again to increase your ability scores."}
{"question": "What does the Alert feat provide?", "answer": "The Alert feat grants a +5 bonus to initiative, prevents you from being surprised while conscious, and stops other creatures from gaining advantage on attack rolls against you as a result of being hidden from you."}
{"question": "What does the Lucky feat allow a character to do?", "answer": "The Lucky feat gives you 3 luck points per long rest. You can spend one luck point to roll an additional d20 when you make an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, or when an attack roll is made against you. You choose which d20 to use (or force the attacker to use)."}
{"question": "What does the Tough feat provide?", "answer": "The Tough feat increases your hit point maximum by an amount equal to twice your character level when you gain the feat. Your hit point maximum increases by an additional 2 points every time you gain a level thereafter."}
{"question": "What does the Magic Initiate feat grant?", "answer": "Magic Initiate allows you to choose a spellcasting class (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard). You learn two cantrips and one 1st-level spell from that class's spell list. You can cast the 1st-level spell once per long rest using the chosen class's spellcasting ability, without expending a spell slot."}
{"question": "Can you cast the 1st-level spell gained from Magic Initiate using your own spell slots if you have levels in a spellcasting class?", "answer": "Typically, yes, if the chosen spell is also on your class's spell list, you could potentially cast it using your own slots, but the free casting granted by the feat is separate."}
{"question": "What benefits does the War Caster feat provide for spellcasters?", "answer": "War Caster grants Advantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration, allows performing somatic components even with weapons/shields in hands, and allows casting certain spells as an opportunity attack."}
{"question": "What does the Sharpshooter feat allow regarding long range and cover?", "answer": "Sharpshooter allows making ranged weapon attacks at long range without Disadvantage, and your ranged weapon attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover."}
{"question": "What damage trade-off does the Sharpshooter feat offer?", "answer": "Before making a ranged weapon attack, you can choose to take a -5 penalty to the attack roll. If the attack hits, you add +10 to the damage."}
{"question": "What benefits does the Great Weapon Master feat provide?", "answer": "When you score a critical hit or reduce a creature to 0 HP with a melee weapon attack on your turn, you can make one melee weapon attack as a bonus action. Also, before making a melee attack with a heavy weapon, you can take a -5 penalty to the attack roll to add +10 to the damage on a hit."}
{"question": "What does the Polearm Master feat allow as a bonus action?", "answer": "When you take the Attack action and attack only with a glaive, halberd, quarterstaff, or spear, you can use your bonus action to make a melee attack with the opposite end of the weapon, dealing 1d4 bludgeoning damage."}
{"question": "What reaction does the Polearm Master feat grant?", "answer": "While wielding a glaive, halberd, pike, quarterstaff, or spear, other creatures provoke an opportunity attack from you when they *enter* the reach you have with that weapon."}
{"question": "What does the Sentinel feat allow you to do when you hit a creature with an opportunity attack?", "answer": "When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, the creature's speed becomes 0 for the rest of the turn, stopping its movement."}
{"question": "How does the Sentinel feat affect creatures trying to Disengage?", "answer": "Creatures within your reach still provoke opportunity attacks from you even if they take the Disengage action before leaving your reach."}
{"question": "What reaction does the Sentinel feat grant when an enemy attacks an ally?", "answer": "When a creature within 5 feet of you makes an attack against a target other than you (and that target doesn't have this feat), you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against the attacking creature."}
{"question": "What does the Resilient feat allow you to choose?", "answer": "The Resilient feat allows you to choose one ability score, increase it by 1 (to a max of 20), and gain proficiency in saving throws using that ability."}
{"question": "Can you gain proficiency in a saving throw you already have proficiency in using the Resilient feat?", "answer": "No. You must choose an ability score for which you lack saving throw proficiency when taking the Resilient feat."}
{"question": "What does the Skilled feat grant?", "answer": "The Skilled feat allows you to gain proficiency in any combination of three skills or tools of your choice."}
{"question": "What does the Healer feat allow you to do with a healer's kit?", "answer": "As an action, you can spend one use of a healer's kit to stabilize a creature (no check needed) and restore 1 hit point to it. Additionally, as an action, you can spend one use to restore 1d6 + 4 hit points + additional hit points equal to the creature's maximum number of Hit Dice (usable once per creature per short/long rest)."}
{"question": "What does the Tavern Brawler feat provide regarding unarmed strikes and improvised weapons?", "answer": "Tavern Brawler increases Str or Con by 1 (max 20), makes your unarmed strike use a d4 for damage, grants proficiency with improvised weapons, and allows attempting a grapple as a bonus action after hitting with an unarmed strike or improvised weapon."}
{"question": "What does the Chef feat provide?", "answer": "Chef increases Con or Wis by 1 (max 20), grants proficiency with Cook's Utensils, allows cooking special food during a short rest for temporary HP, and allows cooking treats during a long rest that grant advantage on saves against Frightened/Charmed."}
{"question": "What is an Epic Boon feat?", "answer": "An Epic Boon feat grants powerful, often unique abilities typically available only at 20th level or as a special reward from the DM, representing near-mythic power."}
{"question": "Can a character take a Fighting Style feat if they already have a fighting style from their class?", "answer": "Yes, but they cannot select the same Fighting Style more than once, even if they get the option from multiple sources (class feature or feat)."}
{"question": "What is roleplaying in the context of Dungeons & Dragons?", "answer": "Roleplaying is the act of embodying a character within the game's fantasy world, making decisions, speaking, and describing actions from that character's perspective, based on their personality, background, alignment, and goals."}
{"question": "What is the difference between active and descriptive roleplaying?", "answer": "Active roleplaying involves speaking 'in character,' using voices or mannerisms. Descriptive roleplaying involves describing the character's actions, words, mood, and intent ('My character tries to persuade the guard...'). Both are valid ways to play."}
{"question": "How can a character's Alignment influence roleplaying?", "answer": "Alignment provides a general framework for a character's moral and ethical outlook (e.g., Lawful Good characters value honesty and societal rules, Chaotic Evil characters prioritize personal gain through violence). Players can use alignment as a guide for how their character might react to situations or make decisions."}
{"question": "Should a player always act strictly according to their character's alignment?", "answer": "No. Alignment is a guideline, not a straitjacket. Characters can experience internal conflict, make mistakes, or act against their usual principles. Consistent actions define alignment more than the label itself. The focus should be on believable character choices, not rigid adherence."}
{"question": "What are Personality Traits, Ideals, Bonds, and Flaws used for?", "answer": "These elements, often suggested by a character's Background, provide starting points and inspiration for roleplaying a character's specific personality, core beliefs, important connections, and weaknesses, making them feel more distinct and three-dimensional."}
{"question": "How can a DM use NPCs to encourage player roleplaying?", "answer": "DMs can portray NPCs with distinct personalities, voices, and motivations, address specific player characters directly, ask players how their characters react emotionally or physically, and create social situations where character interaction is key to success."}
{"question": "How can players use their characters' ability scores to inform roleplaying?", "answer": "High or low scores can suggest personality traits. A character with high Strength might be protective or direct, while one with low Charisma might be awkward or blunt. High Wisdom might suggest calmness, while low Intelligence might imply impulsiveness."}
{"question": "What is 'metagaming' and why is it generally discouraged?", "answer": "Metagaming is using knowledge the player possesses, but the character realistically wouldn't know, to make decisions in the game (e.g., knowing a monster's specific weakness from reading the Monster Manual). It's discouraged because it breaks immersion and undermines the challenge and discovery elements of the game."}
{"question": "How should players handle knowledge their character wouldn't have (like monster stats or adventure plots)?", "answer": "Players should strive to make decisions based only on what their character knows and has experienced within the game world, separating player knowledge from character knowledge."}
{"question": "What role does social interaction play in D&D?", "answer": "Social interaction is one of the three pillars of play. It involves characters talking with NPCs (and each other), negotiating, gathering information, persuading, deceiving, or intimidating, often resolved through a combination of roleplaying and ability checks."}
{"question": "What is an NPC's 'Attitude' (Friendly, Indifferent, Hostile) and how does it affect social interaction?", "answer": "Attitude describes an NPC's initial disposition towards the characters. Friendly NPCs are helpful, Indifferent NPCs are neutral, and Hostile NPCs are obstructive or aggressive. Roleplaying and ability checks can potentially shift an NPC's attitude."}
{"question": "When might a DM call for a Charisma check during roleplaying?", "answer": "A DM might call for a Charisma check (Deception, Intimidation, Performance, or Persuasion) when a character tries to influence an NPC and the outcome is uncertain or depends on the character's force of personality, eloquence, or trickery, often modified by the quality of the roleplaying."}
{"question": "Can good roleplaying grant Advantage on a social ability check?", "answer": "Yes, the DM can grant Advantage on an ability check (like Persuasion or Deception) if the player's roleplaying is particularly convincing, creative, or well-suited to influencing the specific NPC."}
{"question": "How can players use the Help action during social interactions?", "answer": "A player can use the Help action to aid an ally making a social ability check (like Persuasion). The helping player should describe how their character contributes to the conversation or action to grant the ally Advantage on their check."}
{"question": "Is it acceptable for player characters within the same party to have disagreements or conflicts?", "answer": "Yes, intra-party conflict based on differing character goals, alignments, or personalities can lead to interesting roleplaying. However, players should ensure these conflicts don't devolve into disruptive out-of-character arguments or actions that sabotage the group's fun."}
{"question": "What should happen if roleplayed intra-party conflict becomes disruptive?", "answer": "The DM or players should pause the game, discuss the issue out-of-character, and establish boundaries to ensure the conflict remains constructive within the game's narrative and doesn't negatively impact player enjoyment."}
{"question": "What does the phrase 'That's what my character would do' mean, and how should it be used?", "answer": "It's often used to justify a character's actions based on their established personality or alignment. While valid for character consistency, it should not be used as an excuse for disruptive, antagonistic, or party-sabotaging behavior that ruins fun for other players."}
{"question": "How can involving elements from a character's backstory enhance roleplaying?", "answer": "Bringing in NPCs, locations, unresolved issues, or goals from a character's background makes the campaign world feel more connected to that character, provides personal stakes, and offers opportunities for meaningful character development through roleplaying."}
{"question": "Should DMs treat NPC interactions purely mechanically (based on checks) or purely through freeform roleplaying?", "answer": "Most DMs find a balance. Roleplaying sets the stage and can influence NPC attitude and DCs, while ability checks introduce an element of chance and reflect the character's inherent skills when the outcome is uncertain."}
{"question": "How can describing a character's actions, rather than just speaking in first-person, contribute to roleplaying?", "answer": "Describing actions allows players who are less comfortable with acting to still convey their character's personality, mood, and intent effectively (e.g., 'Gareth nervously wrings his hands while asking the question' vs. just asking the question)." }
{"question": "What is a Short Rest in D&D 5e?", "answer": "A Short Rest is a period of downtime lasting at least 1 hour, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds."}
{"question": "What is the primary benefit characters can gain during a Short Rest?", "answer": "Characters can choose to spend one or more Hit Dice (up to their maximum) during a Short Rest. For each Hit Die spent, the player rolls the die type specified by their class and adds their Constitution modifier, regaining that many hit points."}
{"question": "Can a character regain spell slots during a Short Rest?", "answer": "Most spellcasters do not regain spell slots on a Short Rest. The exception is the Warlock, who regains all their Pact Magic spell slots after a Short or Long Rest. Some other class features (like a Wizard's Arcane Recovery or a Druid's Wild Shape) might also recharge on a Short Rest."}
{"question": "Can a character finish a Short Rest if they engage in brief combat?", "answer": "No. A Short Rest requires at least 1 hour of uninterrupted light activity. Any period of strenuous activity, including fighting, casting spells (other than cantrips), or walking for more than a few minutes, interrupts the rest, and it must be started over to gain any benefit."}
{"question": "What is a Long Rest in D&D 5e?", "answer": "A Long Rest is an extended period of downtime, typically lasting at least 8 hours. During this time, a character sleeps (or performs light activity like reading or keeping watch for no more than 2 hours)."}
{"question": "What Hit Points are regained after a Long Rest?", "answer": "A character regains all lost hit points upon finishing a Long Rest."}
{"question": "How many Hit Dice are regained after a Long Rest?", "answer": "A character regains spent Hit Dice equal to half of their maximum number of Hit Dice (minimum of one die), rounded down."}
{"question": "What happens to expended spell slots after a Long Rest?", "answer": "Most spellcasting classes regain all their expended spell slots after finishing a Long Rest."}
{"question": "What other resources are typically refreshed by a Long Rest?", "answer": "Many class features and special abilities that have limited uses per day (like a Barbarian's Rage uses, a Cleric's Channel Divinity, many spell-like abilities) are regained after finishing a Long Rest."}
{"question": "What can interrupt a Long Rest and prevent its benefits?", "answer": "A Long Rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity lasting at least 1 hour. Examples include walking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity. If interrupted, the character gains no benefit and must restart the 8-hour period."}
{"question": "Is sleeping required for a Long Rest?", "answer": "Most creatures need at least 6 hours of sleep during the 8-hour rest period. The remaining time can be light activity like reading or keeping watch. Elves are an exception, requiring only 4 hours of Trance (meditation)."}
{"question": "How is damage calculated when a creature falls?", "answer": "A creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it falls."}
{"question": "What is the maximum amount of damage a creature can take from falling?", "answer": "The maximum damage a creature takes from a fall is 20d6 bludgeoning damage (representing a fall of 200 feet or more)."}
{"question": "What condition does a creature land with after falling?", "answer": "Unless the creature avoids taking damage from the fall (e.g., through magic or a special ability), it lands prone."}
{"question": "Can falling onto water reduce or negate falling damage?", "answer": "The core rules do not specify that water reduces falling damage. Water behaves like a hard surface at high impact speeds. The DM might make an exception for very deep water or specific circumstances, but RAW (Rules As Written), the damage applies."}
{"question": "How long can a creature typically hold its breath?", "answer": "A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds, which is 5 rounds)."}
{"question": "What happens when a creature runs out of breath or starts choking?", "answer": "After running out of held breath, a creature can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round). At the start of its next turn after that, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying."}
{"question": "Can a creature that drops to 0 HP due to suffocation be stabilized?", "answer": "No, a creature dying from suffocation cannot regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again."}
{"question": "What level of obscurement does Dim Light create?", "answer": "Dim Light creates a Lightly Obscured area."}
{"question": "What is the effect of being in a Lightly Obscured area?", "answer": "Creatures in a Lightly Obscured area have Disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight."}
{"question": "What level of obscurement does Darkness create?", "answer": "Darkness creates a Heavily Obscured area."}
{"question": "What is the effect of being in a Heavily Obscured area?", "answer": "A creature in a Heavily Obscured area effectively has the Blinded condition when trying to see anything in that area. They cannot see through it."}
{"question": "How does Darkvision function in Dim Light?", "answer": "A creature with Darkvision treats Dim Light within its specified range as if it were Bright Light."}
{"question": "How does Darkvision function in complete Darkness?", "answer": "A creature with Darkvision treats Darkness within its specified range as if it were Dim Light. They can see, but cannot discern color (only shades of gray)."}
{"question": "Can a creature with Darkvision see through magical darkness?", "answer": "No. Darkvision cannot penetrate darkness created by magic, such as the *Darkness* spell, unless a specific feature (like the Warlock's Devil's Sight invocation) allows it."}
{"question": "How far does Blindsight typically extend?", "answer": "Blindsight usually has a specified radius (e.g., 10 feet, 30 feet, 60 feet). Within that radius, the creature can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight."}
{"question": "Can Blindsight detect invisible creatures?", "answer": "Yes. Since Blindsight does not rely on sight, it can perceive the location of invisible creatures within its radius."}
{"question": "What limitation applies to Tremorsense?", "answer": "Tremorsense allows detecting vibrations through contact with the ground or the same substance. It typically cannot detect flying or floating creatures, or creatures on a different surface."}
{"question": "What are the key benefits of Truesight?", "answer": "Truesight allows seeing in normal/magical darkness, seeing invisible creatures/objects, automatically detecting visual illusions and succeeding on saves against them, perceiving the true form of shapechangers/transformed creatures, and seeing into the Ethereal Plane, all within a specified range."}
{"question": "What does one round of combat represent in game time?", "answer": "One round of combat represents approximately 6 seconds in the game world."}
{"question": "How is the order of turns determined in combat?", "answer": "At the start of combat, every participant makes a Dexterity check called an Initiative roll. The results are ranked from highest to lowest, establishing the turn order for the entire combat."}
{"question": "What happens if multiple creatures tie on their Initiative roll?", "answer": "If there's a tie, the DM decides the order among tied DM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the order among tied player characters. The DM breaks ties between player characters and DM-controlled creatures."}
{"question": "What can a creature typically do on its turn in combat?", "answer": "On its turn, a creature can typically take one Action and Move up to its speed. It might also be able to take one Bonus Action and one Reaction (though reactions occur in response to triggers, potentially outside its own turn)."}
{"question": "Can you choose the order of your Action and Movement on your turn?", "answer": "Yes. You can move, take your action, then move more; or take your action, then move; or move your full speed without taking an action."}
{"question": "What is the difference between the Dash action and regular movement?", "answer": "Regular movement uses your speed (e.g., 30 feet). The Dash action grants you additional movement for the turn equal to your speed (effectively doubling your potential movement distance if you only Dash and move)."}
{"question": "What does the Disengage action allow you to do?", "answer": "Taking the Disengage action prevents your movement for the rest of the current turn from provoking Opportunity Attacks."}
{"question": "What are the benefits of taking the Dodge action?", "answer": "Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has Disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with Advantage. You lose this benefit if you are Incapacitated or your speed drops to 0."}
{"question": "How does the Help action work in combat?", "answer": "You can use the Help action to aid an ally attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint or distract the target, granting your ally Advantage on their *first* attack roll against that creature before the start of your next turn."}
{"question": "Can you use the Hide action if creatures can clearly see you?", "answer": "No. You cannot hide from a creature that can see you clearly. You need to be at least Lightly Obscured (like in dim light or foliage) or behind cover to attempt the Hide action, making a Dexterity (Stealth) check."}
{"question": "What is the Ready action used for?", "answer": "The Ready action allows you to prepare a specific Action (or to move up to your speed) to use later in the round as your Reaction, in response to a perceptible trigger that you define when you take the Ready action."}
{"question": "Can you take a Bonus Action every turn?", "answer": "No. You can only take a Bonus Action on your turn if a specific spell, class feature, or other game rule explicitly grants you the ability to do something as a Bonus Action. If you have nothing granting a Bonus Action, you don't get one."}
{"question": "How many Reactions does a creature get per round?", "answer": "A creature gets only one Reaction per round. Once you use your Reaction, you cannot take another one until the start of your next turn."}
{"question": "When does a Reaction occur?", "answer": "A Reaction is an instant response to a specific trigger defined by a spell, feature, or situation (like an Opportunity Attack). It can happen on your turn or someone else's, immediately after the trigger unless specified otherwise."}
{"question": "What is the 'free object interaction' allowed on a turn?", "answer": "During either your move or your action, you can interact with one object freely, such as drawing or stowing a weapon, opening or closing an unlocked door, withdrawing a potion, etc. Any further interactions usually require the Utilize action."}
{"question": "What is the difference between melee attack range and reach?", "answer": "Most creatures have a reach of 5 feet, meaning they can make melee attacks against targets within 5 feet. Some weapons (with the Reach property) or creatures extend this reach, typically to 10 feet."}
{"question": "Do you have Disadvantage on a ranged attack roll if an enemy is adjacent (within 5 feet) to you?", "answer": "Yes. If you make a ranged attack while a hostile creature you can see is within 5 feet of you and isn't incapacitated, you have Disadvantage on the attack roll."}
{"question": "What are the three degrees of cover and their effects?", "answer": "Half cover (+2 AC/Dex saves), Three-quarters cover (+5 AC/Dex saves), and Total cover (cannot be targeted directly by attacks or most spells)." }
{"question": "How is cover determined when using miniatures on a grid?", "answer": "Draw imaginary lines from one corner of the attacker's space to all corners of the target's space. If 1 or 2 lines are blocked by an obstacle, the target has Half cover. If 3 or 4 lines are blocked, the target has Three-quarters cover. If all lines are blocked, the target has Total cover."}
{"question": "If you attack a target you cannot see (e.g., in darkness or invisible), what happens?", "answer": "Your attack roll has Disadvantage. If the target isn't in the space you aimed at, you miss automatically."}
{"question": "If a creature cannot see you, how does that affect your attacks against it?", "answer": "If a creature cannot see you, you have Advantage on attack rolls against it."}
{"question": "What is required to use the Two-Weapon Fighting bonus action?", "answer": "You must take the Attack action and make at least one attack with a Light melee weapon held in one hand. You can then use your Bonus Action to attack with a *different* Light melee weapon held in your other hand."}
{"question": "What ability check contest is involved in Grappling or Shoving?", "answer": "The attacker makes a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's choice of either Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics)."}
{"question": "Can you make multiple Grapple or Shove attempts if you have the Extra Attack feature?", "answer": "Yes. Grappling and Shoving replace individual attacks. If you have Extra Attack, you can replace any or all of the attacks granted by the Attack action with Grapple or Shove attempts."}
{"question": "What is the minimum damage dealt by an attack, even with penalties?", "answer": "Damage cannot be reduced below 0. If modifiers and damage rolls result in 0 or less, the attack deals 0 damage."}
{"question": "Does resistance stack with effects that reduce damage by a flat amount?", "answer": "Yes, but the order matters. Flat reductions are typically applied first, then resistance halves the remaining damage."}
{"question": "Does vulnerability stack with effects that increase damage by a flat amount?", "answer": "Yes, apply flat increases first, then vulnerability doubles the result."}
{"question": "What is Damage Immunity?", "answer": "Immunity to a damage type means a creature takes zero damage from effects dealing that type of damage."}
{"question": "What happens if a creature takes damage exactly equal to its current hit points?", "answer": "The creature drops to 0 hit points and falls unconscious (or dies if it's a typical monster), potentially making death saving throws if it's a player character."}
{"question": "Does taking damage while at 0 HP cause instant death?", "answer": "Not usually. Taking any damage while at 0 HP causes one automatic Death Saving Throw failure (or two failures if the damage was from a critical hit). However, if the damage equals or exceeds the creature's maximum hit points, it causes instant death."}
{"question": "Can you take the Search action during combat?", "answer": "Yes, you can use your Action to take the Search action during combat. This typically involves making a Wisdom (Perception) check to spot something hidden or a Wisdom (Insight) check to read an opponent's intentions."}
{"question": "Can you take the Study action during combat?", "answer": "Yes, you can use your Action to take the Study action. This typically involves making an Intelligence check (using skills like Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, or Religion) to recall information or deduce something about an opponent or the environment."}
{"question": "When might you use the Utilize action in combat?", "answer": "You would use the Utilize action to interact with a second object on your turn (after your free interaction), or to use certain objects that require manipulation, like setting a hunting trap, pouring oil, using a ram, donning/doffing a shield, or interacting with complex mechanisms."}
{"question": "How does interacting with water (swimming) affect combat?", "answer": "Swimming requires movement. If you lack a swim speed, each foot of swimming costs 1 extra foot of movement (more in rough water). Melee weapon attacks might have disadvantage unless using piercing weapons. Ranged weapon attacks are made at disadvantage within normal range and automatically miss beyond normal range."}
{"question": "Can you light a torch or lantern as your free object interaction?", "answer": "No. Lighting a torch or lantern requires using a tinderbox, which typically takes an action (or bonus action for easily accessible fuel sources like an already-oiled torch), specifically the Utilize action."}
{"question": "What happens if you are hit by an attack while climbing?", "answer": "Unless you are anchored with a climber's kit, taking damage while climbing might require you to make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (DM's discretion) to avoid falling."}
{"question": "Can you attack while climbing?", "answer": "Yes, but it can be difficult. You generally need at least one hand free to attack. The DM might impose disadvantage on the attack roll or require ability checks depending on the climbing surface and situation."}
{"question": "How does controlling a mount work in combat?", "answer": "If controlling a trained mount, it acts on your initiative count and follows your direction. It can only take the Dash, Disengage, or Dodge actions on its turn. You can choose whether it acts before or after you."}
{"question": "Can your mount attack while you are riding it in combat?", "answer": "A controlled mount generally cannot take the Attack action; it is limited to Dash, Disengage, or Dodge. An independent mount acts on its own turn and initiative, and can attack according to its nature."}
{"question": "If your mount takes the Dodge action, do you also benefit from attacks against you having disadvantage?", "answer": "No. The Dodge action taken by the mount only benefits the mount itself. An attacker can choose to target you or your mount."}
{"question": "What happens if your mount is subjected to an effect that forces it to move, like the *Fear* spell?", "answer": "If the mount moves against its will, you must typically make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to avoid falling off and landing prone."}
{"question": "Does fire function normally underwater?", "answer": "No. Non-magical fire (like torches) is extinguished underwater. Creatures and objects fully submerged have resistance to fire damage. Spells that create fire might fail or function differently at the DM's discretion."}
{"question": "What is the 'Surprise Round' in 5e combat?", "answer": "There isn't technically a 'Surprise Round'. Instead, if any combatants are surprised when initiative is rolled, they cannot take an action or a reaction on their first turn of the combat, and they cannot move until after their turn ends. Combat proceeds in normal initiative order."}
{"question": "How is it determined if a creature is surprised at the start of combat?", "answer": "The DM determines who might be surprised based on the circumstances (e.g., an ambush). If surprised, a creature makes a Wisdom (Perception) check contested by the ambusher's Dexterity (Stealth) check. Any creature that doesn't notice a threat is surprised."}
{"question": "Can you delay your turn in initiative order?", "answer": "No. You cannot choose to act later in the round. You can, however, use the Ready action to prepare an action or movement to take in response to a specific trigger later in the round, using your reaction."}
{"question": "What happens if you use the Ready action to move up to your speed?", "answer": "You declare a trigger. When that trigger occurs, you can use your reaction to move up to your speed. This movement occurs outside of your normal turn."}
{"question": "Can you cast a cantrip as a readied action?", "answer": "Yes. You can use the Ready action to prepare to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, including a cantrip. You cast it on your turn (holding the energy) and release it with your reaction when the trigger occurs."}
{"question": "If you are hidden and make a ranged spell attack, are you revealed?", "answer": "Yes. Making any attack (weapon or spell) reveals your position immediately after the attack hits or misses."}
{"question": "Can you take cover behind another creature?", "answer": "Yes. A creature can provide half cover (+2 AC/Dex saves) if it's between you and an attacker or effect and covers at least half of you."}
{"question": "What is the rule for hitting cover instead of the target?", "answer": "When an attack misses a target that has cover, the DM can rule that the attack hit the cover instead, potentially damaging or destroying it if it has hit points."}
{"question": "If you grapple a creature, can you then use subsequent attacks from the Extra Attack feature to attack it?", "answer": "Yes. Grappling replaces only one attack from the Attack action. If you have Extra Attack, you can use your remaining attack(s) to make weapon attacks, unarmed strikes, or even another grapple/shove attempt against the creature you just grappled (or another target within reach)." }
{"question": "Can you make an opportunity attack with a ranged weapon?", "answer": "No. Opportunity attacks explicitly require making a *melee* attack (using a weapon or an unarmed strike)." }
{"question": "What happens if an effect imposes multiple conditions simultaneously, like being both Restrained and Poisoned?", "answer": "The creature suffers the effects of all conditions simultaneously. In this case, its speed would be 0, attacks against it have advantage, its attacks and Dex saves have disadvantage (from Restrained), AND its attacks and ability checks have disadvantage (from Poisoned). Disadvantage doesn't stack, so it just has disadvantage once on attacks and applicable checks/saves."}
{"question": "If you are reduced to 0 HP by damage that includes multiple types (e.g., piercing and poison), do you make multiple death saving throw failures if it causes you to fail?", "answer": "No. Taking damage from a single source (even if it includes multiple types) while at 0 HP causes only one death save failure (or two if it was a critical hit), regardless of the number of damage types involved."}
{"question": "Does healing magic work on constructs?", "answer": "Most healing spells specify they target 'creatures'. Constructs are creatures and can generally be healed by spells like *Cure Wounds*, unless the spell specifies otherwise (e.g., targeting only 'living creatures'). Some features, like Lay on Hands, might specify 'not Undead or Constructs'."}
{"question": "Does healing magic work on undead?", "answer": "Most healing spells specify they target 'creatures' but often have no effect on Undead or Constructs. Spells like *Cure Wounds* typically don't heal Undead. Some specific effects might harm Undead instead of healing them (DM's discretion or specific spell text)." }
{"question": "If a creature falls prone while flying using magical means (like the *Fly* spell), does it fall?", "answer": "Typically, yes. The prone condition states the creature falls if flying unless it can hover or is held aloft by magic. While the *Fly* spell grants flight, it doesn't usually grant the ability to hover inherently, so falling prone would likely cause the creature to fall unless the DM rules the magic itself prevents it."}
{"question": "What type of saving throw does the Bard cantrip *Vicious Mockery* impose?", "answer": "The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take psychic damage and have Disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn."}
{"question": "What happens to a creature that fails its saving throw against the Bard spell *Dissonant Whispers*?", "answer": "On a failed Wisdom saving throw, the creature takes psychic damage and must immediately use its reaction, if available, to move as far as its speed allows away from the caster. It doesn't move into obviously dangerous ground."}
{"question": "Can a creature repeat its saving throw against *Tasha's Hideous Laughter*?", "answer": "Yes. At the end of each of its turns, and each time it takes damage, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw, ending the spell's effect (being prone and incapacitated with laughter) on a success."}
{"question": "What is a key limitation of the *Suggestion* spell?", "answer": "The suggested course of action must sound reasonable. Asking the creature to harm itself or do something obviously suicidal automatically negates the effect of the spell."}
{"question": "How does the *Heat Metal* spell typically affect a creature wearing metal armor?", "answer": "As a bonus action on subsequent turns, the caster can cause the heated object (like armor) to deal fire damage again. If the creature is wearing or holding the object and takes damage, it must succeed on a Constitution save or drop the object/have disadvantage (depending on specifics)."}
{"question": "What is the casting time of *Healing Word*?", "answer": "Healing Word has a casting time of 1 Bonus Action."}
{"question": "Can you cast *Healing Word* (a bonus action) and *Cure Wounds* (an action) on the same turn?", "answer": "No. If you cast any spell using a Bonus Action (like *Healing Word*), the only other spells you can cast on that same turn are cantrips with a casting time of 1 Action. You cannot cast another spell using a spell slot (like *Cure Wounds*) with your action."}
{"question": "What condition does the *Hypnotic Pattern* spell potentially impose on creatures?", "answer": "Creatures in the area that fail a Wisdom saving throw become Charmed for the duration. While Charmed this way, they are also Incapacitated and have a speed of 0."}
{"question": "How does the Bard's Magical Secrets feature allow them to learn spells from other classes?", "answer": "At certain levels (typically 10th, 14th, 18th), the Magical Secrets feature allows a Bard to choose a limited number of spells from *any* class's spell list, adding them to their Bard spells known. These spells count as Bard spells for the character."}
{"question": "What type of damage does the Cleric cantrip *Sacred Flame* deal, and what kind of saving throw does it require?", "answer": "Sacred Flame deals radiant damage and requires the target to succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the damage. Notably, it ignores cover."}
{"question": "What does the *Guidance* cantrip do?", "answer": "The caster touches one willing creature. Once before the spell ends (Concentration, up to 1 minute), the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to one ability check of its choice. The target can roll the die before or after making the ability check."}
{"question": "What is the effect of the *Bless* spell?", "answer": "Up to three creatures chosen by the caster gain a d4 bonus that they can add to every attack roll or saving throw they make while the spell lasts (Concentration, up to 1 minute)."}
{"question": "What is the range of the *Cure Wounds* spell vs the *Healing Word* spell?", "answer": "*Cure Wounds* has a range of Touch. *Healing Word* has a range of 60 feet."}
{"question": "What is the benefit of the *Shield of Faith* spell?", "answer": "The caster chooses one creature within range (60 feet). Until the spell ends (Concentration, up to 10 minutes), the target gains a +2 bonus to their Armor Class (AC)."}
{"question": "How does the Cleric spell *Spiritual Weapon* function?", "answer": "As a bonus action, the Cleric creates a floating spectral weapon within range. On subsequent turns, the Cleric can use their bonus action to move the weapon and make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. It lasts for 1 minute and doesn't require concentration."}
{"question": "What are the effects of the *Spirit Guardians* spell?", "answer": "Spectral guardians appear in a 15-foot radius around the caster. When a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Wisdom saving throw, taking radiant (if caster is good/neutral) or necrotic (if evil) damage on a failed save, or half on success. The area is also difficult terrain for enemies."}
{"question": "What is required to cast *Revivify*?", "answer": "The spell must be cast within 1 minute of the target creature's death and requires diamonds worth 300 GP, which the spell consumes."}
{"question": "What condition is a creature typically in after being returned to life by the *Raise Dead* spell?", "answer": "A creature restored by *Raise Dead* returns with 1 hit point and suffers a -4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the creature finishes a long rest, the penalty reduces by 1 until it disappears."}
{"question": "Does the *Heal* spell restore hit points based on a dice roll?", "answer": "No. The 6th-level spell *Heal* restores exactly 70 hit points to the target creature and also ends blindness, deafness, and any diseases affecting the target."}
{"question": "What is the primary effect of the Cleric spell *Divine Word*?", "answer": "The caster utters a divine word. Any celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend within 30 feet that hears it and has 50 HP or fewer is banished. Any other creature with 40 HP or fewer is deafened, 30 HP or fewer is blinded and deafened, or 20 HP or fewer is stunned, blinded, and deafened."}
{"question": "Are Cleric Domain Spells automatically known or prepared?", "answer": "Cleric Domain Spells are always considered prepared once the Cleric reaches the level required to access them. They do not count against the number of spells the Cleric can prepare each day."}
{"question": "Can a Cleric cast spells as rituals?", "answer": "Yes. Clerics have the Ritual Casting feature, allowing them to cast any Cleric spell they have prepared that also has the Ritual tag as a ritual, without expending a spell slot."}
{"question": "What does the Druid cantrip *Shillelagh* do?", "answer": "As a bonus action, the Druid imbues a club or quarterstaff they are holding with nature's power for 1 minute. For the duration, they can use their Wisdom modifier instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using that weapon, and the weapon's damage die becomes a d8. The weapon also becomes magical."}

{"question": "If a Legendary Action costs 2 points, and the creature has 3 points, can it use that action?", "answer": "Yes. It spends 2 points and has 1 point remaining for that round (which it might be able to use on a 1-point option at the end of another creature's turn)."}

{"question": "What is Attunement in relation to magic items?", "answer": "Attunement is a special bond a creature must form with certain powerful or complex magic items before they can use the item's magical properties. It represents the user linking their own magical essence to the item."}
{"question": "How can a character tell if a magic item requires Attunement?", "answer": "The description of a magic item will explicitly state if Attunement is required to use its magical properties."}
{"question": "What happens if you use a magic item requiring Attunement without being attuned to it?", "answer": "You generally gain only the nonmagical benefits of the item. For example, a magic shield requiring attunement still functions as a normal shield (+2 AC) if wielded unattuned, but provides none of its magical effects."}
{"question": "How does a character Attune to a magic item?", "answer": "To attune, a character must spend a Short Rest (at least 1 hour) focusing only on that item while being in physical contact with it (e.g., meditating with it, practicing with a weapon). If the rest is uninterrupted, attunement occurs at the end."}

{"question": "Can a character voluntarily end their Attunement to a cursed magic item?", "answer": "No. Attunement to a cursed item cannot be ended voluntarily. The curse must first be broken, typically using magic like the *Remove Curse* spell, before attunement can end."}
{"question": "If a magic item has a prerequisite (e.g., 'Requires Attunement by a Wizard'), who can attune to it?", "answer": "Only a creature meeting that specific prerequisite can attune to the item. In the example, only a character with at least one level in the Wizard class could attune."}
{"question": "If an item requires Attunement 'by a spellcaster', what qualifies a creature?", "answer": "A creature qualifies as a spellcaster for attunement if they can cast at least one spell using their own class features or racial traits. Being able to cast spells solely from other magic items does not count."}
{"question": "How do magic items that are meant to be worn typically fit different creatures?", "answer": "Magic items intended to be worn (like armor, boots, cloaks, rings) generally adjust themselves magically to fit the wearer, regardless of size or build, within humanoid norms (DM may rule otherwise for extreme cases or non-humanoid shapes)."}

{"question": "Can a character wear multiple magic rings?", "answer": "Yes, a character can wear multiple magic rings on different fingers and benefit from their effects simultaneously, up to their attunement limit if the rings require attunement."}
{"question": "How is a magic cloak or cape typically worn?", "answer": "It must be fastened around the shoulders to provide its benefits."}

{"question": "How are properties of magic items typically activated?", "answer": "Activation methods vary. Many items have passive properties active while worn/wielded.

{"question": "What is a Command Word for a magic item?", "answer": "A Command Word is a specific word or phrase that must be spoken (or sometimes signed) clearly to activate one or more of a magic item's properties."}
{"question": "Does identifying a magic item reveal its Command Word?", "answer": "Yes. Both the *Identify* spell and identifying an item during a short rest reveal all its properties, including how to activate them, which includes any command words."}
{"question": "Can a character use a magic weapon they are not proficient with?", "answer": "Yes, they can wield and attack with it, gaining any magical damage bonuses or effects on hit, but they do *not* add their proficiency bonus to the attack roll."}
{"question": "Does a magic weapon automatically overcome resistance or immunity to nonmagical damage?", "answer": "Yes. Any attack made with a magic weapon is considered magical, overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage."}
{"question": "How does a character learn the number of charges remaining in a magic item?", "answer": "The *Identify* spell reveals the number of charges currently remaining. A creature attuned to the item also inherently knows the number of charges it has."}
{"question": "What is the general role of deities in the D&D multiverse?", "answer": "Deities typically rule over aspects of the cosmos and mortal life, grant divine magic to followers like Clerics and Paladins, reside on the Outer Planes corresponding to their alignment/nature, and sometimes interact with mortals through avatars, omens, or interventions."}

{"question": "How is the content of a Treasure Hoard determined?", "answer": "The DM uses the Random Treasure Hoard table (DMG Ch 7), rolling on the row corresponding to the CR of the hoard's owner or main guardian. This determines the amount of monetary treasure and the number (and potentially rarity) of magic items present."}
{"question": "How often should a DM typically include a Treasure Hoard in their adventures?", "answer": "As a general guideline, DMs might aim to award treasure equivalent to one roll on the Random Treasure Hoard table approximately once per game session or after completing a major adventure milestone."}

{"question": "What does a treasure preference of 'Any' mean for a monster's hoard?", "answer": "It indicates the hoard can contain any mix of monetary treasure types (coins, gems, art, etc.) and magic items from any category or theme, determined randomly using the standard tables."}

{"question": "How can a DM determine an appropriate monetary reward for completing a quest?", "answer": "A suitable quest reward can often be determined by rolling once on the Random Treasure Hoard table, using the party's average level as the equivalent Challenge Rating (CR)." }

{"question": "Why is establishing mutual respect and trust important in a D&D group?", "answer": "Mutual respect creates a safe environment where players feel comfortable being themselves, speaking up, getting into character, and contributing fully to the game, leading to the best experiences."}
{"question": "Who is responsible for upholding the principles of respect at the table?", "answer": "Everyone at the table shares the responsibility, including the DM and all players. While the DM often leads difficult conversations, resolving issues that affect everyone's fun is a group effort."}
{"question": "Why should a DM pitch potential adventures or campaign themes to players beforehand?", "answer": "Pitching the game allows players to understand the expected tone, themes, and potential conflicts, helping them decide if it's a game they want to play and enabling conversations about content boundaries before play begins."}
{"question": "What kind of information should a DM share when setting expectations for a campaign?", "answer": "DMs should share the overall tone (e.g., serious, silly, horror), themes they want to explore, potential in-world conflicts, inspirations, and general play style (e.g., roleplay-heavy, combat-focused)."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the Game Expectations Sheet mentioned in the DMG?", "answer": "It's a tool to help facilitate communication at the start of a game. The DM outlines the game's theme and potentially sensitive elements, and players anonymously provide their limits, hopes, and concerns, ensuring everyone is comfortable."}
{"question": "What is the difference between a 'soft limit' and a 'hard limit' regarding game content?", "answer": "A soft limit applies to sensitive topics that might cause discomfort and should be handled carefully or possibly avoided. A hard limit applies to topics that must not be mentioned or described at all, as they make someone feel unsafe."}
{"question": "What are some common examples of topics that might be set as hard or soft limits?", "answer": "Common limits include graphic violence (especially towards children/animals), specific phobias (spiders, snakes), non-consensual themes, racism, enslavement, and depictions of sexual content or exploitation."}
{"question": "Why is anonymous communication sometimes preferred for discussing limits?", "answer": "Some players might feel uncomfortable discussing personal limits or phobias openly, especially in a new group. Anonymous methods (like surveys or written sheets) allow everyone to share honestly without pressure."}
{"question": "What should happen immediately if a player signals that a limit (hard or soft) has been crossed during gameplay?", "answer": "The DM (and other players) should immediately stop or redirect the scene without debate or demanding explanation. Thank the player for communicating their needs, adjust the content, and move on."}
{"question": "What is an agreed-upon signal used for communicating limits?", "answer": "It's a pre-discussed gesture (like an 'X' symbol), code word, or object used by players to instantly signal discomfort or a limit violation, allowing the DM to adjust the scene quickly and without discussion."}
{"question": "What are the three likely reasons for conflict occurring between player characters (intra-party conflict)?", "answer": "1) A player is intentionally being disruptive. 2) Real-world conflict between players is manifesting in-game. 3) Genuine differences in character personalities or goals are being roleplayed appropriately."}
{"question": "How should conflict between players (not just characters) be handled?", "answer": "Player vs. player conflicts should ideally be resolved away from the gaming table through direct, respectful communication between the individuals involved."}
{"question": "Is roleplayed conflict between characters always bad?", "answer": "No. Disagreements between characters about in-game decisions or differing morals can be a valid and interesting part of roleplaying, as long as it doesn't become genuinely disruptive or reflect out-of-character animosity."}
{"question": "What does it mean for a DM to 'share the spotlight'?", "answer": "It means ensuring all players get opportunities to participate, act, and have their characters featured, rather than letting one player dominate the conversation or action consistently."}
{"question": "How should a DM handle a player who consistently tries to dominate the game or bully other players?", "answer": "The DM should address the behavior privately with the player, explaining how it negatively affects others' fun and asking them to change. If the behavior persists, removing the player from the group may be necessary."}
{"question": "How should a DM handle using tragic elements from a character's backstory?", "answer": "Understand player preferences first. Use backstory elements to create stakes but ensure characters have a chance to heroically avert or mitigate the worst outcomes. Tragedy should feel like a consequence of choices, not a predetermined event, especially during active play."}
{"question": "What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of hiding DM die rolls behind a screen?", "answer": "Hiding rolls maintains mystery and allows the DM to 'fudge' results (use sparingly and secretly!) to save a character or enhance drama. The drawback is it can sometimes feel less impartial to players."}
{"question": "What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of making DM die rolls openly?", "answer": "Rolling openly demonstrates impartiality, as players see the raw results. The drawback is the DM loses the ability to subtly adjust outcomes for narrative pacing or player survivability."}
{"question": "How can a DM encourage overly cautious players to act more boldly?", "answer": "Techniques include: avoiding purely random/punitive traps, introducing time pressure (use cautiously), telegraphing major encounters in advance, and having an out-of-game conversation about play style expectations."}
{"question": "What is the 'social contract' regarding adventure hooks?", "answer": "The DM agrees to provide reasonably appealing reasons for characters to go on adventures. In return, players agree to generally accept these hooks rather than willfully derailing the prepared adventure."}
{"question": "How should disagreements about rules interpretations be handled during a game session?", "answer": "Groups should establish a policy. Options include pausing to discuss, letting the DM make a quick ruling to keep the game moving (and discussing later), or designating a specific player as the rule reference."}
{"question": "What is 'metagaming' regarding character knowledge?", "answer": "Metagaming is using player knowledge (e.g., monster weaknesses from the Monster Manual, future plot points from reading an adventure) to influence character decisions when the character wouldn't realistically have that information."}
{"question": "How should a DM address disruptive 'antisocial behavior' from a player?", "answer": "Address it directly, often privately first. Explain that using the game to act out harmful fantasies or being a 'jerk' (even if claiming 'it's what my character would do') is ruining fun for others and must stop if they want to remain in the group."}
{"question": "Should 'Evil' player characters be allowed?", "answer": "It depends on the group and campaign style. If allowed, the DM must talk with the player beforehand to ensure their concept of 'evil' aligns with the group's expectations and won't be disruptive or PVP-focused (unless that's the agreed-upon game)." }
{"question": "What are some principles DMs can use to counter players attempting to exploit rules loopholes?", "answer": "Remind players that: 1) Rules aren't literal physics. 2) The game isn't a realistic economic simulation (discouraging infinite wealth schemes). 3) Certain rules apply only in combat context. 4) Rules rely on good-faith interpretation for group fun."}
{"question": "Does a DM need to be an expert on all the rules?", "answer": "No. Familiarity is helpful, but facilitating fun is more important. DMs can ask players for input, look up rules between sessions, or make fair rulings on the spot. Players should generally be responsible for knowing their own character's abilities."}
{"question": "What are some extra considerations for running games online (Virtual Tabletop)?", "answer": "Establish clear expectations for communication (e.g., using text chat for jokes vs voice for game focus), who controls tokens on the map, and whether physical or digital dice rollers are preferred/required."}
{"question": "What are the four basic steps suggested for creating a D&D campaign?", "answer": "1. Lay out the premise (core conflicts, setting). 2. Draw in the players (hooks, character ties). 3. Plan adventures (link smaller conflicts to larger ones). 4. Bring it to an end (plan potential conclusions and character arcs)."}
{"question": "How is creating a campaign similar to creating a single adventure?", "answer": "Both follow similar steps involving establishing a premise/conflict, creating hooks, planning encounters/events, and considering an ending. A campaign is essentially like a larger adventure composed of smaller, interconnected adventures."}
{"question": "Why is it important that a campaign's story isn't fully predetermined?", "answer": "The players' characters are protagonists, and their actions must have a meaningful impact on how the story unfolds. Predetermining the exact outcome can lead to 'railroading' and diminish player agency and enjoyment."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of keeping a Campaign Journal?", "answer": "A campaign journal helps the DM track events, NPCs, clues, and player choices across sessions. It aids memory, ensures consistency, allows for foreshadowing, brings closure to unresolved plots, and helps sustain excitement over long campaigns."}
{"question": "How can a Campaign Journal be used for foreshadowing?", "answer": "By reviewing notes from earlier sessions, the DM can identify minor details, NPCs, or unresolved threads that can be reintroduced later in the campaign, giving them greater significance and rewarding attentive players."}
{"question": "How does player input contribute to campaign creation?", "answer": "Players contribute directly by sharing preferences and feedback, and indirectly through their character choices and actions during play. Understanding player input helps the DM craft stories and challenges the players will find engaging."}
{"question": "What are the three types of character motivations DMs should consider?", "answer": "1. Goal (short-term reason for adventuring). 2. Ambition (long-term personal aspiration). 3. Quirks and Whims (preferences and impulses that emerge during play)."}
{"question": "How can a DM create character-focused adventures?", "answer": "By designing adventures that directly involve a character's backstory, personal goals, ambitions, or challenge their specific skills or flaws, while ensuring the whole party has reasons to participate."}
{"question": "How often is it recommended to include character-focused adventures?", "answer": "Character-focused adventures should occur occasionally for each character throughout the campaign, but not so often that one character consistently overshadows the others."}
{"question": "What is a suggested structure for managing overarching campaign conflicts?", "answer": "Introduce around three compelling conflicts early on. Focus adventures on different conflicts over time. Use the tiers of play (level transitions around 5, 11, 17) as potential milestones to resolve smaller conflicts and introduce larger-scale ones."}
{"question": "What is a 'Conflict Arc' in campaign planning?", "answer": "A conflict arc outlines how a specific campaign conflict might develop over time: how characters first encounter it, how it escalates, and what potential climactic resolutions might look like, often structured around the tiers of play."}
{"question": "What defines a 'Heroic Fantasy' campaign?", "answer": "This is the default D&D style, featuring adventurers using magic and might against monstrous threats, often involving dungeon crawls and saving local communities."}
{"question": "What characterizes a 'Sword and Sorcery' campaign?", "answer": "It features a grimmer world, morally ambiguous protagonists motivated by self-interest, decadent cities, dangerous magic, and often pits heroes against evil spellcasters or ancient evils."}
{"question": "What are key elements of an 'Epic Fantasy' campaign?", "answer": "Epic fantasy emphasizes the struggle between clear Good and Evil, with heroic characters driven by higher purpose, facing moral quandaries, and often including elements of romance and high stakes for the world."}
{"question": "What themes define a 'Mythic Fantasy' campaign?", "answer": "This style draws on ancient myths and legends, featuring characters performing legendary deeds, interacting directly with gods or their agents, potentially having divine ancestry, and facing mythic monsters."}
{"question": "What is crucial when planning a 'Supernatural Horror' campaign?", "answer": "Creating an atmosphere of dread through pacing and description, and discussing content limits with players beforehand due to the potentially intense and personal nature of horror themes."}
{"question": "What type of gameplay is emphasized in an 'Intrigue' campaign?", "answer": "Intrigue campaigns focus on political maneuvering, espionage, secrets, and social interaction, often prioritizing skills, contacts, and cleverness over direct combat."}
{"question": "What type of encounters are common in a 'Mystery' campaign?", "answer": "Mystery campaigns feature investigation, puzzle-solving, gathering clues, and scrutinizing NPC motives to solve crimes or uncover hidden truths, balanced with other encounter types."}
{"question": "What elements define a 'Swashbuckling' campaign?", "answer": "Swashbuckling involves daring heroes, charismatic action, dramatic escapes, courtly intrigue, piracy, and often takes place in coastal cities or aboard ships."}
{"question": "What is the focus of a 'War' campaign?", "answer": "War campaigns center on characters whose actions significantly impact a larger military conflict, undertaking specific missions like sabotage, reconnaissance, capturing objectives, or leading troops."}
{"question": "Can different fantasy subgenres or even science fiction elements be mixed in a D&D campaign?", "answer": "Yes, DMs can 'cross the streams,' incorporating elements from various fantasy flavors, science fiction, or other genres (like planar travel, futuristic tech, whimsical fairy tales) to create a unique campaign setting."}
{"question": "What are the two main options for choosing a campaign setting?", "answer": "A DM can either use a pre-existing published campaign setting (like Greyhawk, Forgotten Realms) or create their own unique homebrew world."}
{"question": "What is an advantage of creating your own campaign setting?", "answer": "The DM has complete creative control, players won't have pre-existing knowledge that could spoil surprises, and there's no need to memorize extensive published lore."}
{"question": "What are five key questions to consider when creating a homebrew campaign setting?", "answer": "1. What is the setting called? 2. What are the prominent factions/organizations? 3. How common is magic? 4. What mysteries does the world hold? 5. What role do gods play?"}
{"question": "What is a 'Session Zero'?", "answer": "Session Zero is an initial meeting before the first actual play session, used for character creation, discussing expectations, setting content boundaries (limits), establishing house rules, and ensuring everyone is aligned for the campaign."}
{"question": "Why is it helpful for players to establish how their characters know each other before the campaign starts?", "answer": "Establishing pre-existing relationships (family, friends, shared history, mutual acquaintance) helps create party cohesion from the beginning and provides immediate roleplaying hooks."}
{"question": "What are some common ways a new adventuring party might form?", "answer": "They might meet at a specific event, answer the same call for adventurers, be introduced by a mutual patron or NPC, have grown up together, or meet by chance in a common location like a tavern."}
{"question": "What kind of information should a DM share with players during Session Zero?", "answer": "Basic details about the starting location, prominent local NPCs, any major recent or current events affecting the region, and any house rules or variant rules being used."}
{"question": "Should a DM fully detail the entire world map and history before starting a campaign?", "answer": "No, it's often better to start small, detailing only the immediate starting area and its surroundings. The rest of the world can be developed organically as the campaign progresses and players explore."}
{"question": "What is the difference between an episodic and a serialized campaign structure?", "answer": "An episodic campaign consists of mostly self-contained adventures with few connections. A serialized campaign features interconnected adventures that build upon each other to form a larger, continuous story arc."}
{"question": "How can a DM link adventures together in a serialized campaign?", "answer": "Links can include recurring villains, clues leading to the next location, introducing larger factions, transporting needed items, having events in one adventure directly cause the next, or using hooks from the Adventure Connections table (DMG Ch 5)."}
{"question": "What are 'Recurring Elements' in a campaign, and why are they useful?", "answer": "Recurring elements are NPCs, locations, organizations, or even specific items that appear multiple times. They help players get invested by creating familiarity, building relationships (positive or negative), and making the world feel more alive and consistent."}
{"question": "What is a 'Break Episode' in a campaign?", "answer": "A break episode is a low-stakes session or short adventure deliberately inserted between major plot arcs, allowing characters (and players) to relax, reflect, explore relationships, or engage in lighter activities (like managing Bastions or attending a festival)."}
{"question": "When should a campaign typically end?", "answer": "A campaign should end when its major conflicts and character arcs reach a satisfying conclusion, which doesn't necessarily have to be at level 20. Ending naturally is better than dragging it out."}
{"question": "What should a DM prioritize as a campaign nears its conclusion?", "answer": "Besides resolving the main plot, the DM should ensure player characters have opportunities to address and potentially conclude their personal goals and ambitions developed throughout the campaign."}
{"question": "What are options if a DM feels a campaign is stalling or losing momentum?", "answer": "Options include: discussing with players to get input on new directions, allowing another player to take over as DM, magically transporting the characters to a new setting, or finding a way to bring the current story to an earlier but satisfying grand finale."}
{"question": "What is the core mechanic used in D&D 5e to determine the outcome of uncertain actions?", "answer": "The core mechanic is the D20 Test, which involves rolling a 20-sided die (d20), adding relevant modifiers, and comparing the total to a target number (DC or AC)."}
{"question": "What are the three types of D20 Tests?", "answer": "The three types of D20 Tests are Ability Checks, Saving Throws, and Attack Rolls."}
{"question": "When should a DM ask for a D20 Test?", "answer": "A D20 Test is warranted only when an action has a meaningful chance of both success and failure, and the outcome has consequences. Trivial tasks or impossible attempts typically don't require a roll."}
{"question": "What is the target number for an Ability Check or Saving Throw called?", "answer": "The target number for an ability check or saving throw is called the Difficulty Class (DC)."}
{"question": "What is the target number for an Attack Roll called?", "answer": "The target number for an attack roll is the target's Armor Class (AC)."}
{"question": "What determines success or failure on a D20 Test?", "answer": "If the total of the d20 roll plus all applicable modifiers equals or exceeds the target number (DC or AC), the test is a success. Otherwise, it's a failure."}
{"question": "What modifiers are typically added to a d20 roll?", "answer": "Modifiers include: 1) The relevant Ability Modifier (e.g., Strength for Athletics, Dexterity for Stealth). 2) The Proficiency Bonus, if proficient with the skill, tool, weapon, or saving throw being used. 3) Circumstantial bonuses or penalties from spells, features, or situations."}
{"question": "What are the standard DCs for Easy, Medium, and Hard tasks?", "answer": "Typical DCs are 10 for Easy, 15 for Medium, and 20 for Hard tasks."}
{"question": "When might a DM set a DC higher than 20?", "answer": "DCs of 25 (Very Hard) or 30 (Nearly Impossible) represent tasks that are exceptionally challenging, often requiring high ability scores, proficiency, and favorable circumstances or magic to succeed, especially for lower-level characters."}
{"question": "How does Advantage affect a D20 Test?", "answer": "When rolling with Advantage, you roll two d20s and use the higher result before adding modifiers."}
{"question": "How does Disadvantage affect a D20 Test?", "answer": "When rolling with Disadvantage, you roll two d20s and use the lower result before adding modifiers."}
{"question": "What grants Advantage or imposes Disadvantage?", "answer": "Advantage/Disadvantage can be granted by specific spells, class features, conditions, or actions (like Help or Dodge). The DM can also grant circumstantial Advantage or impose Disadvantage based on favorable or unfavorable conditions affecting the roll."}
{"question": "What happens if multiple sources grant Advantage or impose Disadvantage on the same roll?", "answer": "They do not stack. You only ever roll a maximum of two d20s. If you have both Advantage and Disadvantage affecting the same roll, they cancel out, and you roll only one d20 normally."}
{"question": "What does rolling a natural 20 on an Attack Roll mean?", "answer": "A natural 20 on an attack roll is always a hit, regardless of AC or modifiers, and it is also a Critical Hit, allowing you to roll damage dice twice."}
{"question": "What does rolling a natural 1 on an Attack Roll mean?", "answer": "A natural 1 on an attack roll is always a miss, regardless of AC or modifiers."}
{"question": "Does rolling a natural 20 on an Ability Check or Saving Throw guarantee success?", "answer": "No. Unlike attack rolls, a natural 20 on an ability check or saving throw is simply a roll of 20 before modifiers. The total must still meet or exceed the DC. The DM might narrate it as an exceptional success, but it doesn't bypass the DC requirement."}
{"question": "Does rolling a natural 1 on an Ability Check or Saving Throw guarantee failure?", "answer": "No. Unlike attack rolls, a natural 1 on an ability check or saving throw is simply a roll of 1 before modifiers. If the total (1 + modifiers) still meets or exceeds the DC, the check or save succeeds. The DM might narrate it as a clumsy success or introduce a minor complication, but it's not an automatic failure."}
{"question": "What does 'Success at a Cost' mean?", "answer": "It's an optional DM technique where if a character fails a D20 Test by only 1 or 2 points, the DM might offer them the choice to succeed anyway, but with an added complication or minor setback (e.g., succeeding on an attack but dropping the weapon)." }
{"question": "What are 'Degrees of Failure'?", "answer": "This is an optional DM technique where the consequences of failing a D20 Test vary depending on how much the roll failed by. Failing by 5 or more might trigger a worse outcome than failing by only 1 or 2."}
{"question": "What are 'Degrees of Success'?", "answer": "This is an optional DM technique where succeeding on a D20 Test might yield better results the higher the roll exceeds the DC (e.g., hitting closer to the bullseye in archery, learning extra information on an Investigation check)."}
{"question": "When resolving an effect that affects multiple targets simultaneously (like *Fireball*), how is damage rolled?", "answer": "You typically roll the damage dice only once for the effect, and that single damage result is applied to all affected targets (modified by individual saves, resistances, etc.)."}
{"question": "What does it mean if a saving throw effect deals 'half damage' on a success?", "answer": "A creature that succeeds on the saving throw takes half the amount of damage (rounded down) that they would have taken if they had failed the save."}
{"question": "In what order are damage modifiers, Resistance, and Vulnerability applied?", "answer": "First apply any adjustments (bonuses, penalties, multipliers). Second, apply Resistance (halving). Third, apply Vulnerability (doubling)."}
{"question": "Can a character choose to automatically fail a saving throw?", "answer": "Yes, a character can voluntarily choose to fail any saving throw they are forced to make."}
{"question": "What ability check might be used to determine the outcome of an arm-wrestling match?", "answer": "This would typically be a contested Strength (Athletics) check between the two participants."}
{"question": "If one creature tries to hold a door shut while another tries to force it open, how might this be resolved?", "answer": "The creature holding the door might set the DC using 8 + their Strength modifier + their proficiency bonus (if proficient, DM's call). The creature trying to force it open makes a Strength (Athletics) check against that DC. Alternatively, it could be a contested Strength (Athletics) check."}
{"question": "How does hiding typically interact with perception?", "answer": "A creature attempting to hide makes a Dexterity (Stealth) check. The result of this check becomes the DC for any Wisdom (Perception) checks made by others attempting to detect the hidden creature."}
{"question": "When might a DM need to improvise during a D&D session?", "answer": "Improvisation is often necessary when players take unexpected actions, ask questions about unplanned details, or encounter situations not explicitly covered by the rules or prepared adventure material."}
{"question": "What is the 'Yes, and...' principle in improvisation, and how does it apply to D&D?", "answer": "'Yes, and...' involves accepting what other participants offer (player actions/ideas) and building upon it. In D&D, this means weaving player choices and contributions into the ongoing story whenever possible, rather than shutting them down."}
{"question": "What is the 'No, but...' principle in improvisation for D&D?", "answer": "'No, but...' is used when a character's desired action isn't possible or feasible. Instead of just saying no, the DM offers an alternative action, consequence, or piece of information that keeps the game moving forward."}
{"question": "If players ask about something unplanned (like a specific guild in a city), what are the DM's options?", "answer": "The DM can say 'Yes, and...' by improvising the guild's existence and details, potentially using random tables or drawing on existing lore. Or they can say 'No, but...' by stating the specific guild doesn't exist *but* offering a related alternative (like a solitary expert or a different organization) that fulfills the players' underlying goal."}
{"question": "What resources can a DM use as aids for improvisation?", "answer": "Aids include lists of NPC names, random tables (for encounters, settlement details, dungeon quirks, etc.), existing maps, the DM's campaign journal, and general knowledge of fantasy tropes and the game world."}
{"question": "When should a DM improvise the amount of damage dealt by an environmental hazard or unusual situation?", "answer": "When a character is exposed to a danger not covered by standard rules (like falling into coals, being struck by lightning, wading through lava), the DM can use the Improvising Damage guidelines."}
{"question": "What are the suggested damage dice for minor improvised damage (e.g., falling bookcase, poison needle prick)?", "answer": "The guidelines suggest roughly 1d10 damage for minor setbacks like being burned by coals or hit by small falling objects."}
{"question": "What are the suggested damage dice for more significant improvised damage (e.g., lightning strike, falling into a firepit)?", "answer": "The guidelines suggest roughly 2d10 damage for more dangerous but survivable hazards."}
{"question": "What are the suggested damage dice for severe improvised damage (e.g., falling rubble in a tunnel, acid vat)?", "answer": "The guidelines suggest roughly 4d10 damage for severe environmental dangers."}
{"question": "What are the suggested damage dice for very deadly improvised damage (e.g., crushed by walls, wading through lava)?", "answer": "The guidelines suggest roughly 10d10 damage for hazards likely to instantly kill lower-level characters or severely wound higher-level ones."}
{"question": "What damage levels are suggested for truly catastrophic improvised damage (e.g., submerged in lava, hit by crashing fortress)?", "answer": "For near-certain death scenarios, the guidelines suggest 18d10 or even 24d10 damage."}
{"question": "How does the DM gauge if an improvised damage amount is a 'Nuisance' or 'Deadly'?", "answer": "The DMG provides a 'Damage Severity and Level' table. The DM cross-references the character's level tier with the intended severity (Nuisance or Deadly) to find an appropriate damage die range (e.g., 1d10 is a nuisance for levels 1-4 but potentially deadly below that; 10d10 is deadly for levels 11-16 but catastrophic for lower levels)."}
{"question": "Should the DM always roll for improvised damage?", "answer": "No, the DM can choose to use the average damage listed in the guidelines (e.g., average of 1d10 is 5, average of 4d10 is 22) for quicker resolution or more predictable outcomes."}
{"question": "How can the 'Yes, and...' principle apply when improvising answers to player questions?", "answer": "If a player asks about something reasonable but unplanned, saying 'Yes' and adding a detail builds on their engagement. Example: Player asks 'Is there a temple nearby?' DM: 'Yes, and you recall seeing the symbol of Pelor on a small shrine down the street.'" }
{"question": "How can the 'No, but...' principle apply when improvising answers?", "answer": "If a player's request is impossible or disruptive, saying 'No' but offering an alternative keeps momentum. Example: Player: 'Can I fly to the moon?' DM: 'No, but you recall legends of a portal on the tallest mountain peak said to lead to the Astral Sea.'" }
{"question": "When improvising NPC dialogue or reactions, what aspects of the NPC are most helpful to consider?", "answer": "Focusing on the NPC's alignment, core personality traits (adjectives), motivations, goals, and current attitude (Friendly/Indifferent/Hostile) provides a strong foundation for improvising their responses."}
{"question": "Does a DM need extensive backstory for every NPC to improvise effectively?", "answer": "No. For minor NPCs encountered unexpectedly, simply deciding on their basic attitude, one or two personality quirks, and their immediate goal is often sufficient for improvisation."}
{"question": "What should a DM do if unsure how to rule on an improvised situation?", "answer": "Make a ruling that seems fair and keeps the game moving. If needed, make a note and revisit the rule or situation after the session to establish consistency for the future."}
