A radiant well is a planar link to one of the celestial planes, and it sheds searing, bright daylight in a 60-foot radius around itself and up into the clouds. This makes them excellent landmarks for navigation, though their position can be shifted by ebon tides and terrain manipulation. Any creature entering a radiant well falls for 1 round and then is ejected upward at relatively high speed from another well within 2d20 miles (for evil creatures, this increases to 1d100 miles). The force of being ejected from the well propels a Small or smaller creature up about 30 feet before falling to the ground beside the well (potentially taking normal falling damage). Medium and Large creatures are pushed up about 15 feet, and Huge or larger creatures simply land at the edge of the well.\n\nParticularly large or active radiant wells sometimes inflict radiant damage on evil-aligned creatures. These more active wells are sometimes used as nodes or portals to celestial planes by fey wizards and clerics.",

On a failure, the creature gains one level of shadow corruption. On a success, the creature resists corruption for the time being, but the DC of future saves made for this reason increase by 1. The DC returns to 10 when the creature gains one or more levels of shadow corruption or when it spends at least 1 week outside the Shadow Realm.\n\nShadow magic is dangerous for mortal creatures to wield since it carries the risk of shadow corruption. Whenever any humanoid that isn't an umbral human, bearfolk, darakhul, shadow fey, or shadow goblin casts any shadow magic spell, then the next time it finishes a long rest, it must make a Charisma saving throw with a DC of 10 + the highest level of shadow magic spell cast. On a failure, the creature gains one level of shadow corruption. Gnomes, elfmarked, and elves make the saving throw with advantage.\n\nShadow corruption can be removed in three ways:\n\n- A corrupted creature that spends 1 week per current level of shadow corruption outside the Shadow Realm reduces its level of shadow corruption by one.
