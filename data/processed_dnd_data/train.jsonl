{"text": "Below is a question about Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition rules. Provide a clear and accurate answer based on the official rules.\n\n### Question:\nCan you extend the duration of armor of Agathys by gaining more temporary hit points?\n\n### Answer:\nThe spell is meant to work only as long as you have the temporary hit points that the spell grants. When those temporary hit points are gone, the spell is done. Keep in mind that temporary hit points aren't cumulative. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you don't add them together, unless a game feature says you can. You decide which temporary hit points to keep. As an example, let's say you're a warlock with the Dark One's Blessing feature, which gives you temporary hit points when you reduce a creature to 0 hit points. You currently have 2 temporary hit points remaining from armor of Agathys, you just slew a monster, and your Dark One's Blessing can now give you 4 temporary hit points. If you take those temporary hit points, they replace the ones from armor of Agathys and end that spell, so you might not want to take them and keep the spell going instead, so as to continue benefiting from the cold damage it delivers.</s>"}

{"text": "Below is a question about Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition rules. Provide a clear and accurate answer based on the official rules.\n\n### Question:\nWhen you cast a spell like conjure woodland beings, does the spellcaster or the DM choose the creatures that are conjured?\n\n### Answer:\nA number of spells in the game let you summon creatures. Conjure animals, conjure celestial, conjure minor elementals, and conjure woodland beings are just a few examples. Some spells of this sort specify that the spellcaster chooses the creature conjured. For example, find familiar gives the caster a list of animals to choose from. Other spells of this sort let the spellcaster choose from among several broad options. For example, conjure minor elementals offers four options. Here are the first two: One elemental of challenge rating 2 or lower, or Two elementals of challenge rating 1 or lower. The design intent for options like these is that the spellcaster chooses one of them, and then the DM decides what creatures appear that fit the chosen option. For example, if you pick the second option, the DM chooses the two elementals that have a challenge rating of 1 or lower. A spellcaster can certainly express a preference for what creatures shows up, but it's up to the DM to determine if they do. The DM will often choose creatures that are appropriate for the campaign and that will be fun to introduce in a scene.</s>"}

If the answer is yes, there is nothing to dispel or suspend. Here's why: the effects of an instantaneous spell are brought into being by magic, but the effects aren't sustained by magic. The magic flares for a split second and then vanishes. For example, the instantaneous spell animate dead harnesses magical energy to turn a corpse or a pile of bones into an undead creature. That necromantic magic is present for an instant and is then gone. The resulting undead now exists without the magic's help. Casting dispel magic on the creature can't end its mockery of life, and the undead can wander into an antimagic field with no adverse effect.</s>"}

{"text": "Below is a question about Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition rules. Provide a clear and accurate answer based on the official rules.\n\n### Question:\nCan you ready dispel magic to stop another spell from taking effect?\n\n### Answer:\nThe easiest way to stop a spell is to cast counterspell on its caster while it's being cast. If successful, counterspell interrupts the other spell's casting, and that spell fails to take effect. Counterspell works against any spell, regardless of a spell's casting time or duration. With the Ready action, dispel magic can be cast in response to another spell being cast, yet dispel magic can't substitute for counterspell. The main reason is that dispel magic removes a spell that is already on a target, whether that target is a creature, an object, or some other phenomenon. Dispel magic can't dispel something in advance. If a spell isn't already present on a target, dispel magic does nothing to that target. The best that a readied dispel magic can do is dispel a spell immediately after the spell has been cast to prevent it from having any effect after the action used to cast it. For example, on your turn you could say something like this: 'I ready dispel magic, and if the high priest casts a spell on anyone, I cast dispel magic on the target if the spell takes hold.' If the high priest then cast hold person on your companion who fails the save against it, you could unleash your readied dispel magic and end hold person.</s>"}

GMs earn this trust by favoring players whenever possible and focusing on sharing an action-packed story.

{"text": "Below is a question about Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition rules. Provide a clear and accurate answer based on the official rules.\n\n### Question:\nIf a warlock uses Pact of the Blade to bond with a magic weapon, does that weapon have to be a melee weapon, and can the warlock change the weapon's form?\n\n### Answer:\nThe warlock's Pact of the Blade feature lets you create a melee weapon out of nothing. Whenever you do so, you determine the weapon's form, choosing from the melee weapon options in the Weapons table in the Player's Handbook. For example, you can create a greataxe, and then use the feature again to create a javelin, which causes the greataxe to disappear. You can also use Pact of the Blade to bond with a magic weapon, turning it into your pact weapon. This magic weapon doesn't have to be a melee weapon, so you could use the feature on a +1 longbow, for instance. Once the bond is formed, the magic weapon appears whenever you call your pact weapon to you, and you can't change the magic weapon's form when it appears. For example, if you bond with a flame tongue (longsword) and send the weapon to an extradimensional space, the weapon comes back as a longsword when you summon it. You don't get to turn it into a club. Similarly, if you bond with a dagger of venom, you can't summon it as a maul; it's always a dagger.</s>"}

{"text": "Below is a question about Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition rules. Provide a clear and accurate answer based on the official rules.\n\n### Question:\nCan you use green-flame blade and booming blade with Extra Attack, opportunity attacks, Sneak Attack, and other weapon attack options?\n\n### Answer:\nIntroduced in the Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, the green-flame blade and booming blade spells pose a number of questions, because they each do something unusual: require you to make a melee attack with a weapon as part of the spell's casting. First, each of these spells involves a normal melee weapon attack, not a spell attack, so you use whatever ability modifier you normally use with the weapon. (A spell tells you if it includes a spell attack, and neither of these spells do.) For example, if you use a longsword with green-flame blade, you use your Strength modifier for the weapon's attack and damage rolls. Second, neither green-flame blade nor booming blade works with Extra Attack or any other feature that requires the Attack action. Like other spells, these cantrips require the Cast a Spell action, not the Attack action, and they can't be used to make an opportunity attack, unless a special feature allows you to do so. Third, these weapon attacks work with Sneak Attack if they fulfill the normal requirements for that feature. For example, if you have the Sneak Attack feature and cast green-flame blade with a finesse weapon, you can deal Sneak Attack damage to the target of the weapon attack if you have advantage on the attack roll and hit.</s>"}

{"text": "Below is a question about Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition rules. Provide a clear and accurate answer based on the official rules.\n\n### Question:\nIs the breath weapon of a dragon magical?\n\n### Answer:\nIf you cast antimagic field, don armor of invulnerability, or use another feature of the game that protects against magical or nonmagical effects, you might ask yourself, 'Will this protect me against a dragon's breath?' The breath weapon of a typical dragon isn't considered magical, so antimagic field won't help you but armor of invulnerability will. You might be thinking, 'Dragons seem pretty magical to me.' And yes, they are extraordinary! Their description even says they're magical. But our game makes a distinction between two types of magic: the background magic that is part of the D&D multiverse's physics and the physiology of many D&D creatures, and the concentrated magical energy that is contained in a magic item or channeled to create a spell or other focused magical effect. In D&D, the first type of magic is part of nature. It is no more dispellable than the wind. A monster like a dragon exists because of that magic-enhanced nature. The second type of magic is what the rules are concerned about. When a rule refers to something being magical, it's referring to that second type. Determining whether a game feature is magical is straightforward. Ask yourself these questions about the feature: Is it a magic item? Is it a spell? Or does it let you create the effects of a spell that's mentioned in its description? Is it a spell attack? Is it fueled by the use of spell slots? Does its description say it's magical? If your answer to any of those questions is yes, the feature is magical.</s>"}

For instance, you might skip the 'Develop Fantastic Locations' step since the adventure already has detailed locations. Still review the characters to keep them central to your preparation. Create a strong start for each session even if it's not explicitly in the adventure. Abstract secrets and clues from the adventure text so you can reveal them at appropriate moments. List important NPCs that might appear in the session. Review monster stats that could be relevant. The key is to extract and organize the most important elements from the published material using the Lazy DM framework rather than trying to memorize everything.</s>"}

Provide a clear and accurate answer based on the official rules.\n\n### Question:\nWhat's the best way to prepare monsters for my D&D session?\n\n### Answer:\nInstead of preparing whole scenes with locations and monsters together, the Lazy DM method suggests creating a separate list of monsters that might appear in the session. This gives you freedom to improvise combat encounters based on the situation and pacing. Consider what monsters make sense for the locations characters might explore. For reference, note the lazy encounter benchmark to know the line between challenging and potentially deadly encounters.

{"text": "Below is a question about Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition rules. Provide a clear and accurate answer based on the official rules.\n\n### Question:\nDo the first and third benefits of Crossbow Expert turn a hand crossbow into a semiautomatic weapon?\n\n### Answer:\nThe short answer is no. The first benefit of the feat lets you ignore the loading property of the hand crossbow if you're proficient with that weapon. The upshot is that you can fire it more than once if you have a feature like Extra Attack. You're still limited, however, by the fact that the weapon has the ammunition property. The latter property requires you to have a bolt to fire from the hand crossbow, and the hand crossbow isn't going to load itself (unless it's magical or a gnomish invention). You need to load each bolt into the weapon, and doing so requires a hand. To dig deeper into this point, take a look at the following sentence in the definition of the ammunition property: 'Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack.' The sentence tells us two important things. First, you're assumed to be drawing\u2014that is, extracting with your hand\u2014the ammunition from a container. Second, the act of drawing the ammunition is included in the attack and therefore doesn't require its own action and doesn't use up your free interaction with an object on your turn. What does that all mean for a hand crossbow? It means Crossbow Expert makes it possible to fire a hand crossbow more than once with a feature like Extra Attack, provided that you have enough ammunition and you have a hand free to load it for each shot.</s>"}

Provide a clear and accurate answer based on the official rules.\n\n### Question:\nWhy even have a column like Sage Advice when a DM can just make a ruling?\n\n### Answer:\nRules are a big part of what makes D&D a game, rather than simply improvised storytelling. The game's rules are meant to help organize, and even inspire, the action of a D&D campaign. The rules are a tool, and we want our tools to be as effective as possible. No matter how good those tools might be, they need a group of players to bring them to life and a DM to guide their use. The DM is key. Many unexpected things can happen in a D&D campaign, and no set of rules could reasonably account for every contingency. If the rules tried to do so, the game would become unplayable. An alternative would be for the rules to severely limit what characters can do, which would be counter to the open-endedness of D&D. The direction we chose for the current edition was to lay a foundation of rules that a DM could build on, and we embraced the DM's role as the bridge between the things the rules address and the things they don't.</s>"}

{"text": "Below is a question about Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition rules. Provide a clear and accurate answer based on the official rules.\n\n### Question:\nHow does the Lucky feat interact with advantage and disadvantage?\n\n### Answer:\nThe Lucky feat represents extraordinary luck that can help you when you need it most. It lets you spend a luck point; roll an extra d20 for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw; and then choose which d20 to use. This is true no matter how many d20s are in the mix. For example, if you have advantage or disadvantage on your attack roll, you could spend a luck point, roll a third d20, and then decide which of the three dice to use. You still have advantage or disadvantage, since the feat doesn't say it negates it, but you get to pick the die. The upshot of this fact is that a rogue, for instance, who has disadvantage on an attack roll couldn't use Sneak Attack even if the rogue uses the Lucky feat to pick the die. The Lucky feat is a great example of an exception to a general rule. The general rule in this case is the one that tells us how advantage and disadvantage work. The specific rule is the Lucky feat, and we know that a specific rule trumps a general rule if they conflict with each other. If a DM wants advantage and disadvantage to play their normal roles even when the Lucky feat is used, here's a way to do so: roll two d20s for advantage/disadvantage, roll a third d20 for Lucky, eliminate one of the three dice, and then use the higher (for advantage) or lower (for disadvantage) of the two dice that remain.</s>"}

{"text": "Below is a question about Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition rules. Provide a clear and accurate answer based on the official rules.\n\n### Question:\nDoes moonbeam deal damage when you cast it? What about when its effect moves onto a creature?\n\n### Answer:\nThe answer to both questions is no. Here's some elaboration on that answer. Some spells and other game features create an area of effect that does something when a creature enters that area for the first time on a turn or when a creature starts its turn in that area. On the turn when you cast such a spell, you're primarily setting up hurt for your foes on later turns. Moonbeam, for example, creates a beam of light that can damage a creature who enters the beam or who starts its turn in the beam. Here are some spells with the same timing as moonbeam for their areas of effect: blade barrier, cloudkill, cloud of daggers, Evard's black tentacles, forbiddance, moonbeam, sleet storm, spirit guardians. Reading the description of any of those spells, you might wonder whether a creature is considered to be entering the spell's area of effect if the area is created on the creature's space. And if the area of effect can be moved\u2014as the beam of moonbeam can\u2014does moving it into a creature's space count as the creature entering the area? Our design intent for such spells is this: a creature enters the area of effect when the creature passes into it. Creating the area of effect on the creature or moving it onto the creature doesn't count. If the creature is still in the area at the start of its turn, it is subjected to the area's effect. Entering such an area of effect needn't be voluntary, unless a spell says otherwise. You can, therefore, hurl a creature into the area with a spell like thunderwave. We consider that clever play, not an imbalance, so hurl away! Keep in mind, however, that a creature is subjected to such an area of effect only the first time it enters the area on a turn. You can't move a creature in and out of it to damage it over and over again on the same turn. In summary, a spell like moonbeam affects a creature when the creature passes into the spell's area of effect and when the creature starts its turn there. You're essentially creating a hazard on the battlefield.</s>"}

Normally, you can't hide from someone if you're in full view. A lightfoot halfling, though, can try to vanish behind a creature that is at least one size larger, and a wood elf can try to hide simply by being in heavy rain, mist, falling snow, foliage, or similar natural phenomena. It's as if nature itself cloaks a wood elf from prying eyes\u2014even eyes staring right at the elf! Both subraces are capable of hiding in situations when most other creatures can't, but neither subrace's hiding attempt is assured of success; a Dexterity (Stealth) check is required as normal, and an observant foe might later spot a hidden halfling or elf.</s>"}

{"text": "Below is a question about Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition rules. Provide a clear and accurate answer based on the official rules.\n\n### Question:\nDo you always know when you're under the effect of a spell?\n\n### Answer:\nYou're aware that a spell is affecting you if it has a perceptible effect or if its text says you're aware of it. Most spells are obvious. For example, fireball burns you, cure wounds heals you, and command forces you to suddenly do something you didn't intend. Certain spells are more subtle, yet you become aware of the spell at a time specified in the spell's description. Charm person and detect thoughts are examples of such spells. Some spells are so subtle that you might not know you were ever under their effects. A prime example of that sort of spell is suggestion. Assuming you failed to notice the spellcaster casting the spell, you might simply remember the caster saying, 'The treasure you're looking for isn't here. Go look for it in the room at the top of the next tower.' You failed your saving throw, and off you went to the other tower, thinking it was your idea to go there. You and your companions might deduce that you were beguiled if evidence of the spell is found. It's ultimately up to the DM whether you discover the presence of inconspicuous spells. Discovery usually comes through the use of skills like Arcana, Investigation, Insight, and Perception or through spells like detect magic.</s>"}

Here's a summary: Melee weapon attack uses Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls. Ranged weapon attack uses Dexterity modifier for attack and damage rolls. Spell attack uses spellcasting ability modifier for attack roll, and depends on the effect for damage roll.

Every magic weapon can bypass resistances and immunities to damage from nonmagical attacks, but only certain magic weapons are more accurate and damaging than their nonmagical counterparts. For example, a +1 longsword and a giant slayer both give you a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls, whereas neither a flame tongue nor a frost brand provides such a bonus. All four weapons, however, can bypass an earth elemental's resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks. In short, a bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls is considered a special property of a magic weapon, not something that all magic weapons provide automatically.</s>"}

Any leftover damage is taken by the wizard and goes through the following game elements in order: (1) any relevant damage immunity, (2) any relevant damage resistance, (3) any temporary hit points, and (4) real hit points.</s>"}

A wolf, for example, could plausibly try to seize a person with its bite, and the animal wouldn't be able to use its bite attack as long as it held onto the person. Keep in mind that the grappling rule in the Player's Handbook requires the Attack action, so a creature must take that action\u2014rather than Multiattack or another action in the creature's stat block\u2014when it uses that rule. A monster, such as a roper, that has a special grappling attack doesn't follow that rule when using its special attack.</s>"}

That fact isn't too surprising, given the number of ways the game gives you to change your AC! Here are some ways to calculate your base AC: Unarmored: 10 + your Dexterity modifier. Armored: Use the AC entry for the armor you're wearing. For example, in leather armor, you calculate your AC as 11 + your Dexterity modifier, and in chain mail, your AC is simply 16. Unarmored Defense (Barbarian): 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. Unarmored Defense (Monk): 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier. Draconic Resilience (Sorcerer): 13 + your Dexterity modifier. Natural Armor: 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your natural armor bonus. These methods are mutually exclusive; you can benefit from only one at a time. If you have access to more than one, you pick which one to use.</s>"}

{"text": "Below is a question about Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition rules. Provide a clear and accurate answer based on the official rules.\n\n### Question:\nCan a rogue use Sneak Attack more than once per round?\n\n### Answer:\nThe Sneak Attack description specifies that you can use the feature once per turn, but it's not limited to your turn. The feature also doesn't limit the number of times you can use it in a round. You sometimes get a chance to use Sneak Attack on someone else's turn. The most common way for this to happen is when a foe provokes an opportunity attack from you. If the requirements for Sneak Attack are met, your opportunity attack can benefit from that feature. Similarly, a fighter could use Commander's Strike to grant you an attack on the fighter's turn, and if the attack qualifies, it can use Sneak Attack. Both of those options rely on the use of your reaction, so you could do only one of them in a round. Because you get only one reaction per round, you're unlikely to use Sneak Attack more than twice in a round: once with your action and once with your reaction.</s>"}

{"text": "Below is a question about Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition rules. Provide a clear and accurate answer based on the official rules.\n\n### Question:\nDoes surprise happen outside the initiative order as a special surprise round?\n\n### Answer:\nNo, here's how surprise works. The first step of any combat is this: the DM determines whether anyone in the combat is surprised. This determination happens only once during a fight and only at the beginning. In other words, once a fight starts, you can't be surprised again, although a hidden foe can still gain the normal benefits from being unseen. To be surprised, you must be caught off guard, usually because you failed to notice foes being stealthy or you were startled by an enemy with a special ability, such as the gelatinous cube's Transparent trait, that makes it exceptionally surprising. You can be surprised even if your companions aren't, and you aren't surprised if even one of your foes fails to catch you unawares. If anyone is surprised, no actions are taken yet. First, initiative is rolled as normal. Then, the first round of combat starts, and the unsurprised combatants act in initiative order. A surprised creature can't move or take an action or a reaction until its first turn ends (remember that being unable to take an action also means you can't take a bonus action).

{"text": "Below is a question about Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition rules. Provide a clear and accurate answer based on the official rules.\n\n### Question:\nCan you use dispel magic to dispel a magical effect like a vampire's Charm ability or a druid's Wild Shape?\n\n### Answer:\nDispel magic has a particular purpose: to break other spells. It has no effect on a vampire's Charm ability or any other magical effect that isn't a spell. It also does nothing to the properties of a magic item. It can, however, end a spell cast from a magic item or from another source. Spells\u2014they're what dispel magic is about. For example, if you cast dispel magic on a staff of power, the spell fails to disrupt the staff's magical properties, but if the staff's wielder casts hold monster from the staff, dispel magic can end that spell if cast on the target of hold monster. There are abilities and other spells that can end or suspend magical effects that aren't spells. For example, the greater restoration spell can end a charm effect of any sort on a target (such as a vampire's Charm or a dryad's Fey Charm), and a paladin's Aura of Devotion can prevent or suspend such an effect.</s>"}
